## Concepts to think about

   - [ ] **Vellend theory:** Vellend asked: *"Does it make any essential difference whether these variants are alleles or genotypes (in case population genetics) or species (community ecology)?"*


> For any collection of self-replicating things, all their properties arise via four fundamental processes: 
   * **Origination of new types** ‚û°Ô∏è **Speciation:** a subpopulation diverges from the others, forming a new species

   * **Movement from place to place** ‚û°Ô∏è **Dispersal (immigration):**  a speces arrives from somewhere else and joins the        community

   * **Stochastic sampling from one time point to the next** ‚û°Ô∏è **Ecological drift:** the random component to community dynamics (i.e., the probabilities). Causes species abundances to fluctuate randomly, lowering diversity within communities and increasing differences among otherwise equivalent communities

   * **Selection** :arrow_right: **Selection:** occurs when individuals in a population vary in some respect, and when different variants reproduce or replicate themselves at different rates *Ô∏è‚É£

   The above are the factors that can cause a *change* in the **number of species present** in a particular place over time.



   *Ô∏è‚É£ ***Fitness (population genetics)** attempts to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to how good other genotypes are at it.*
   In an ecological community, selection results from deterministic fitness differences between individuals of different species.
   Fitness can be defined in almost exactly the same way as in evolutionary models of asexual, single-species populations, just by substituting the word species for genotype.



   ü§î üí≠ ü§Ø Vellend's theory could be merged with the Chac√≥n et al. (2021) review on *"The Ecology and Evolution of
   Model Microbial Mutualisms"*


   - [ ] Microbes can simultaneously reciprocally exchange benefits and compete with a second species (Bull & Harcombe 2009, Hammarlund et al. 2019). If the net outcome of these interactions is negative, then the two species are not mutualists even if benefits are exchanged.
