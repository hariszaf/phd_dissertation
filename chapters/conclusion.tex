\section{The \textit{who}}

   Insight after this PhD on the \textit{who} question. 

   A lot of \texttt{darn} here

   and a lot of \texttt{pema}

   mention the animal christina found 


   but also the PREGO-oriented \textit{who} when
   someone asks who can do a process, or who lives 
   in a certain environment 




\section{The \textit{where}}

   Using the swamp samples we found that 
   bins from there also live in WHERE!

% PIPELINES
By encapsulating all software and its dependencies in an isolated and easy to reinstall environment (container) containerization addresses this challenge. In addition, packaging a software per container simplifies management of the software requirements but also facilitates the creation and management of standardized workflows/pipelines. Workflow tools such as 
\href{https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language}{Common Workflow Language (CWL)}, 
\href{https://snakemake.github.io}{Snakemake} and \href{https://www.nextflow.io}{Nextflow} have been proven of high value in building such pipelines as they support the connection of multiple independent software.
Another route of access to metagenomics analysis datasets is the Metagenome Exchange Registry which contains mappings between a number of well-established metagenome analysis platforms and their raw data in INSDC. Its aim is to aid comparison and benchmarking of tools and services as well as to help users explore metagenomics data in INSDC that are analysed by third party services. The registry is available as an API with plans to release a user interface in future.
