   \caption{Red bars denote published research with high resource requirements of the various computational methods employed at the IMBBC HPC facility due to (a) long computational times (>48 h), (b) high memory requirements (>128 GB), or (c) high storage requirements (>200 GB). For instance, no eDNA-based community analyses performed at Zorba thus far have required a large amounts of memory.}
