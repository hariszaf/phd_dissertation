\section{The First Topic of this Chapter}
\subsection{Item 1}
The relationship between genotype and phenotype is fundamental to biology.
Many levels of control are introduced when moving from one to the other. 
Systems biology aims at deciphering "the strategy" both at the cell and at higher levels of organization, in case of multicell species, that enables organisms to produce orderly adaptive behavior in the face of widely varying genetic and environmental conditions (\cite{strohman2002maneuvering}); the term "strategy" is used as per \cite{polanyi1968life}.
Systems biology approaches aim at interpreting how a system's properties emerge; from the cell to the community level.
