Some "second generation" methods, including plug-in and smoothed bootstrap techniques, have been developed that are far superior to well-known "first generation" methods, such as rules of thumb, least squares cross-validation, and biased cross-validation. We recommend a "solve-the-equation" plug-in bandwidth selector as being most reliable in terms of overall performance.

 abstract = {We apply the method known as simulated annealing to the following problem in convex optimization: Minimize a linear function over an arbitrary convex set, where the convex set is specified only by a membership oracle. Using distributions from the Boltzmann-Gibbs family leads to an algorithm that needs only O*(√n) phases for instances in ${\Bbb R}^{n}$ . This gives an optimization algorithm that makes $O^{\ast}(n^{4.5})$ calls to the membership oracle, in the worst case, compared to the previous best guarantee of O*(n⁵). The benefits of using annealing here are surprising because such problems have no local minima that are not also global minima. Hence, we conclude that one of the advantages of simulated annealing, in addition to avoiding poor local minima, is that in these problems it converges faster to the minima that it finds. We also give a proof that under certain general conditions, the Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions are optimal for annealing on these convex problems.},

Our analysis shows that the rate of convergence is bounded in terms of natural smoothness parameters of an associated Riemannian manifold. We then apply the method with the manifold defined by the log barrier function to the problems of (1) uniformly sampling a polytope and (2) computing its volume, the latter by extending Gaussian cooling to the manifold setting. In both cases, the total number of steps needed is O*(mn2/3), improving the state of the art. A key ingredient of our analysis is a proof of an analog of the KLS conjecture for Gibbs distributions over manifolds.},

Although a lot of effort is devoted to practical algorithms for polytopes given as an intersection of halfspaces, there is no such method for zonotopes. Our algorithm is based on Multiphase Monte Carlo (MMC) methods, and our main contributions include: (i) a new uniform sampler employing Billiard Walk for the first time in volume computation, (ii) a new simulated annealing generalizing existing MMC by making use of adaptive convex bodies which fit to the input, thus drastically reducing the number of phases. Extensive experiments on zonotopes show our algorithm requires sub-linear number of oracle calls in the dimension, while the best theoretical bound is cubic. Moreover, our algorithm can be easily generalized to any convex body. We offer an open-source, optimized C++ implementation, and analyze its performance. Our code tackles problems intractable so far, offering the first efficient algorithm for zonotopes which scales to high dimensions (e.g. one hundred dimensions in less than 1 h).",

Genome-scale metabolic models, with the assumption of steady state for the internal metabolites, allow the definition of a region of feasible metabolic flux distributions. This space of solutions can be further constrained using experimental flux measurements (normally production or uptake rates of external compounds). Here a random sampling method was used to obtain average values and standard deviations for all the reaction rates in a genome-scale model. These values were used to quantify the significance of changes in metabolic fluxes between different conditions. The significance in flux changes can be compared to the changes in gene transcription of the corresponding enzymes. Our method allowed for identification of specific reactions that are transcriptionally regulated, and we further identified that these reactions can be ascribed to a few key transcription factors. This suggests that the regulation of metabolism has evolved to contain a few flux-regulating transcription factors that could be the target for genetic manipulations in order to redirect fluxes.},

	abstract = {The {Gibb}s sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

   abstract = { The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies with the 16S rRNA gene for characterization of bacterial and archaeal communities has become routine. However, the adoption of sequencing methods for eukaryotes has been slow, despite their significance to natural and engineered systems. There are large variations among the target genes used for amplicon sequencing, and for the 18S rRNA gene, there is no consensus on which hypervariable region provides the most suitable representation of diversity. Additionally, it is unclear how much PCR/sequencing bias affects the depiction of community structure using current primers. The present study amplified the V4 and V8-V9 regions from seven microalgal mock communities as well as eukaryotic communities from freshwater, coastal, and wastewater samples to examine the effect of PCR/sequencing bias on community structure and membership. We found that degeneracies on the 3′ end of the current V4-specific primers impact read length and mean relative abundance. Furthermore, the PCR/sequencing error is markedly higher for GC-rich members than for communities with balanced GC content. Importantly, the V4 region failed to reliably capture 2 of the 12 mock community members, and the V8-V9 hypervariable region more accurately represents mean relative abundance and alpha and beta diversity. Overall, the V4 and V8-V9 regions show similar community representations over freshwater, coastal, and wastewater environments, but specific samples show markedly different communities. These results indicate that multiple primer sets may be advantageous for gaining a more complete understanding of community structure and highlight the importance of including mock communities composed of species of interest. IMPORTANCE The quantification of error associated with community representation by amplicon sequencing is a critical challenge that is often ignored. When target genes are amplified using currently available primers, differential amplification efficiencies result in inaccurate estimates of community structure. The extent to which amplification bias affects community representation and the accuracy with which different gene targets represent community structure are not known. As a result, there is no consensus on which region provides the most suitable representation of diversity for eukaryotes. This study determined the accuracy with which commonly used 18S rRNA gene primer sets represent community structure and identified particular biases related to PCR amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencing in order to more accurately study eukaryotic microbial communities. }

	abstract = {Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are powerful methods to uncover key micro-organisms and processes driving biogeochemical cycling in natural ecosystems. Databases dedicated to depicting biogeochemical pathways (for example, metabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is an abundant organosulfur compound) from metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data are rarely seen. Additionally, a recognized normalization model to estimate the relative abundance and environmental importance of pathways from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data has not been organized to date. These limitations impact the ability to accurately relate key microbial-driven biogeochemical processes to differences in environmental conditions. Thus, an easy-to-use, specialized tool that infers and visually compares the potential for biogeochemical processes, including DMSP cycling, is urgently required. To solve these issues, we developed DiTing, a tool wrapper to infer and compare biogeochemical pathways among a set of given metagenomic or metatranscriptomic reads in one step, based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and a manually created DMSP cycling gene database. Accurate and specific formulae for over 100 pathways were developed to calculate their relative abundance. Output reports detail the relative abundance of biogeochemical pathways in both text and graphical format. DiTing was applied to simulated metagenomic data and resulted in consistent genetic features of simulated benchmark genomic data. Subsequently, when applied to natural metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from hydrothermal vents and the Tara Ocean project, the functional profiles predicted by DiTing were correlated with environmental condition changes. DiTing can now be confidently applied to wider metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, and it is available at https://github.com/xuechunxu/DiTing.},

MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.},

Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is providing key information regarding the evolutionary and functional diversity of microbial life, it has become impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination. Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and generally make use of a limited number of “marker” genes conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes. CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome completeness and contamination and to outperform existing approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of microbial communities.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

An essential step in computational metagenome analysis is taxonomic sequence assignment, which allows identifying the sequenced community members and reconstructing taxonomic bins with sequence data for the individual taxa. For the massive datasets generated by next-generation sequencing technologies, this cannot be performed with de-novo phylogenetic inference methods. We describe an algorithm and the accompanying software, taxator-tk, which performs taxonomic sequence assignment by fast approximate determination of evolutionary neighbors from sequence similarities.Results:Taxator-tk was precise in its taxonomic assignment across all ranks and taxa for a range of evolutionary distances and for short as well as for long sequences. In addition to the taxonomic binning of metagenomes, it is well suited for profiling microbial communities from metagenome samples because it identifies bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic community members without being affected by varying primer binding strengths, as in marker gene amplification, or copy number variations of marker genes across different taxa. Taxator-tk has an efficient, parallelized implementation that allows the assignment of 6 Gb of sequence data per day on a standard multiprocessor system with 10 CPU cores and microbial RefSeq as the genomic reference data.Availability and implementation: Taxator-tk source and binary program files are publicly available at http://algbio.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/software/.Contact:Alice.McHardy@uni-duesseldorf.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples.Results: A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP.Availability and Implementation: Perl script for ARGs-OAP can be downloaded from https://github.com/biofuture/Ublastx\_stageone.

	abstract = {A metagenomic approach and network analysis was used to investigate the wide-spectrum profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their co-occurrence patterns in 50 samples from 10 typical environments. In total, 260 ARG subtypes belonging to 18 ARG types were detected with an abundance range of 5.4 × 10−6–2.2 × 10−1 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The trend of the total ARG abundances in environments matched well with the levels of anthropogenic impacts on these environments. From the less impacted environments to the seriously impacted environments, the total ARG abundances increased up to three orders of magnitude, that is, from 3.2 × 10−3 to 3.1 × 100 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The abundant ARGs were associated with aminoglycoside, bacitracin, β-lactam, chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, quinolone, sulphonamide and tetracycline, in agreement with the antibiotics extensively used in human medicine or veterinary medicine/promoters. The widespread occurrences and abundance variation trend of vancomycin resistance genes in different environments might imply the spread of vancomycin resistance genes because of the selective pressure resulting from vancomycin use. The simultaneous enrichment of 12 ARG types in adult chicken faeces suggests the coselection of multiple ARGs in this production system. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples belonging to the same environment generally possessed similar ARG compositions. Based on the co-occurrence pattern revealed by network analysis, tetM and aminoglycoside resistance protein, the hubs of the ARG network, are proposed to be indicators to quantitatively estimate the abundance of 23 other co-occurring ARG subtypes by power functions.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are widespread among bacteria. However, not all ARGs pose serious threats to public health, highlighting the importance of identifying those that are high-risk. Here, we developed an ‘omics-based’ framework to evaluate ARG risk considering human-associated-enrichment, gene mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our framework classifies human-associated, mobile ARGs (3.6\% of all ARGs) as the highest risk, which we further differentiate as ‘current threats’ (Rank I; 3\%) - already present among pathogens - and ‘future threats’ (Rank II; 0.6\%) - novel resistance emerging from non-pathogens. Our framework identified 73 ‘current threat’ ARG families. Of these, 35 were among the 37 high-risk ARGs proposed by the World Health Organization and other literature; the remaining 38 were significantly enriched in hospital plasmids. By evaluating all pathogen genomes released since framework construction, we confirmed that ARGs that recently transferred into pathogens were significantly enriched in Rank II (‘future threats’). Lastly, we applied the framework to gut microbiome genomes from fecal microbiota transplantation donors. We found that although ARGs were widespread (73\% of genomes), only 8.9\% of genomes contained high-risk ARGs. Our framework provides an easy-to-implement approach to identify current and future antimicrobial resistance threats, with potential clinical applications including reducing risk of microbiome-based interventions.},

Accordingly, there are several tools available for the major steps in a phylogenomics workflow. But for the biologist whose main focus is not bioinformatics, much of the computational work required—such as accessing genomic data on large scales, integrating genomes from different file formats, performing required filtering, stitching different tools together etc.—can be prohibitive. Here I introduce GToTree, a command-line tool that can take any combination of fasta files, GenBank files and/or NCBI assembly accessions as input and outputs an alignment file, estimates of genome completeness and redundancy, and a phylogenomic tree based on a specified single-copy gene (SCG) set. Although GToTree can work with any custom hidden Markov Models (HMMs), also included are 13 newly generated SCG-set HMMs for different lineages and levels of resolution, built based on searches of ∼12 000 bacterial and archaeal high-quality genomes. GToTree aims to give more researchers the capability to make phylogenomic trees.GToTree is open-source and freely available for download from: github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree.

However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of {\textgreater}7700 microbial species. As more than 30\% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).},

Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity—patterns of phylogenetic relatedness among organisms in ecological communities—provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying community assembly. Studies that measure phylogenetic diversity in microbial communities have primarily been limited to a single marker gene approach, using the small subunit of the rRNA gene (SSU-rRNA) to quantify phylogenetic relationships among microbial taxa. In this study, we present an approach for inferring phylogenetic relationships among microorganisms based on the random metagenomic sequencing of DNA fragments. To overcome challenges caused by the fragmentary nature of metagenomic data, we leveraged fully sequenced bacterial genomes as a scaffold to enable inference of phylogenetic relationships among metagenomic sequences from multiple phylogenetic marker gene families. The resulting metagenomic phylogeny can be used to quantify the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities based on metagenomic data sets. We applied this method to understand patterns of microbial phylogenetic diversity and community assembly along an oceanic depth gradient, and compared our findings to previous studies of this gradient using SSU-rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses. Bacterial phylogenetic diversity was highest at intermediate depths beneath the ocean surface, whereas taxonomic diversity (diversity measured by binning sequences into taxonomically similar groups) showed no relationship with depth. Phylogenetic diversity estimates based on the SSU-rRNA gene and the multi-gene metagenomic phylogeny were broadly concordant, suggesting that our approach will be applicable to other metagenomic data sets for which corresponding SSU-rRNA gene sequences are unavailable. Our approach opens up the possibility of using metagenomic data to study microbial diversity in a phylogenetic context.},

Metagenomic sequencing provides a means to access the DNA sequence of uncultured microbes. By combining DNA sequencing of microbial communities with evolutionary modeling and phylogenetic analysis we might obtain new insights into microbiology and also provide a basis for practical tools such as forensic pathogen detection.In this work we present an approach to leverage phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic sequence data to conduct several types of analysis. First, we present a method to conduct phylogeny-driven Bayesian hypothesis tests for the presence of an organism in a sample. Second, we present a means to compare community structure across a collection of many samples and develop direct associations between the abundance of certain organisms and sample metadata. Third, we apply new tools to analyze the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities and again demonstrate how this can be associated to sample metadata.These analyses are implemented in an open source software pipeline called PhyloSift. As a pipeline, PhyloSift incorporates several other programs including LAST, HMMER, and pplacer to automate phylogenetic analysis of protein coding and RNA sequences in metagenomic datasets generated by modern sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina, 454).},

Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-11-538},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Likelihood-based phylogenetic inference is generally considered to be the most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. "Phylogenetic placement," where a reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power offered by likelihood-based approaches to large data sets.
RESULTS: This paper introduces pplacer, a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel. Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for large collections of reads; it is freely available as source code, binaries, and a web service.},

To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {\textgreater}95\% intra-species and {\textless}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

	abstract = {Salts are abundant on Mars, and any liquid water that is present or may have been present on the planet is expected to be hypersaline. Halophilic archaea (family Halobacteriaceae) are the microorganisms best adapted to life at extremes of salinity on Earth. This paper reviews the properties of the Halobacteriaceae that may make the group good candidates for life also on Mars. Many species resist high UV and gamma radiation levels; one species has survived exposure to vacuum and radiation during a space flight; and there is at least one psychrotolerant species. Halophilic archaea may survive for millions of years within brine inclusions in salt crystals. Many species have different modes of anaerobic metabolism, and some can use light as an energy source using the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. They are also highly tolerant to perchlorate, recently shown to be present in Martian soils, and some species can even use perchlorate as an electron acceptor to support anaerobic growth. The presence of characteristic carotenoid pigments (α-bacterioruberin and derivatives) makes the Halobacteriaceae easy to identify by Raman spectroscopy. Thus, if present on Mars, such organisms may be detected by Raman instrumentation planned to explore Mars during the upcoming ExoMars mission.},

Halophilic viruses exist as well. In NaCl-saturated brines such as found in the northern part of Great Salt Lake, Utah, in a few other natural salt lakes, and in saltern crystallizer ponds for the production of salt, we find members of all groups. Blooms of microorganisms have occasionally been observed in the magnesium- and calcium-rich waters of the Dead Sea. Dense communities of extremely halophilic Archaea (family Halobacteriaceae) and of the alga Dunaliella salina often impart a red color to salt-saturated brines. There are different strategies that enable halophilic or halotolerant microorganisms to grow in the presence of high-salt concentrations. A few groups (Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae; the red extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter) maintain molar concentrations of salts (K+, Cl−) intracellularly, and their proteins are functional in a high-salt environment. Other groups (most salt-adapted members of the Bacteria, halophilic algae, and fungi) accumulate organic solutes to provide osmotic balance of their cytoplasm with the hypersaline medium.},

Instead, microbiologists have been forced to use hard-to-remember alphanumeric placeholder labels. Here, we exploit an approach to the generation of well-formed arbitrary Latinate names at a scale sufficient to name tens of thousands of unnamed taxa within GTDB. These newly created names represent an important resource for the microbiology community, facilitating communication between bioinformaticians, microbiologists and taxonomists, while populating the emerging landscape of microbial taxonomic and functional discovery with accessible and memorable linguistic labels.},

Ultraviolet radiation, arsenic content, high salinity, and low dissolved oxygen content, together with extreme daily temperature fluctuations and oligotrophic conditions, shape an environment that recreates the early Earth and, even more so, extraterrestrial conditions. Microbes inhabiting extreme environments face these conditions with different strategies, including formation of intricate microbial communities with an increasing degree of complexity. In that way, biofilms, mats, endoevaporitic mats, domes, and microbialites have been found to exist in association with salars, lagoons, and even volcanic fumaroles in Central Andean extreme environments. They form microbial ecosystems, where light and O2 availability decrease with depth stratification, promoting functional group diversity. This microbial diversity, together with the geochemistry, may favor the precipitation of minerals. This chapter summarizes general concepts in the environmental microbiology of extreme Andean ecosystems, which are explored throughout this book.},

The upper salt concentration limit at which different dissimilatory processes occur in nature appears to be determined to a large extent by bioenergetic constraints. The main factors that determine whether a certain type of microorganism can make a living at high salt are the amount of energy generated during its dissimilatory metabolism and the mode of osmotic adaptation used. I here review new data, both from field observations and from the characterization of cultures of new types of prokaryotes growing at high salt concentrations, to evaluate to what extent the theories formulated 12 years ago are still valid, need to be refined, or should be refuted on the basis of the novel information collected. Most data agree well with the earlier theories. Some new observations, however, are not easily explained: the properties of Natranaerobius and other haloalkaliphilic thermophilic fermentative anaerobes, growth of the sulfate-reducing Desulfosalsimonas propionicica with complete oxidation of propionate and Desulfovermiculus halophilus with complete oxidation of butyrate, growth of lactate-oxidizing sulfate reducers related to Desulfonatronovibrio at 346 g l−1 salts at pH 9.8, and occurrence of methane oxidation in the anaerobic layers of Big Soda Lake and Mono Lake.},

They all must cope with the low water activity of their environment, but different strategies exist to provide osmotic balance of the cells’ cytoplasm with the salinity of the medium. One option used by many halophilic Archaea and a few representatives of the Bacteria is to accumulate salts, mainly KCl and to adapt the entire intracellular machinery to function in the presence of molar concentrations of salts. A more widespread option is the synthesis or accumulation of organic osmotic, so-called compatible solutes. Here, we review the mechanisms of osmotic adaptation in a number of model organisms, including the KCl accumulating Halobacterium salinarum (Archaea) and Salinibacter ruber (Bacteria), Halomonas elongata as a representative of the Bacteria that synthesize organic osmotic solutes, eukaryotic microorganisms including the unicellular green alga Dunaliella salina and the black yeasts Hortaea werneckii and the basidiomycetous Wallemia ichthyophaga, which use glycerol and other compatible solutes. The strategies used by these model organisms and by additional halophilic microorganisms presented are then compared to obtain an integrative picture of the adaptations to life at high salt concentrations in the microbial world.},

	abstract = {NaCl-saturated brines such as saltern crystalliser ponds, inland salt lakes, deep-sea brines and liquids-of-deliquescence on halite are commonly regarded as a paradigm for the limit of life on Earth. There are, however, other habitats that are thermodynamically more extreme. Typically, NaCl-saturated environments contain all domains of life and perform complete biogeochemical cycling. Despite their reduced water activity, ∼0.755 at 5 M NaCl, some halophiles belonging to the Archaea and Bacteria exhibit optimum growth/metabolism in these brines. Furthermore, the recognised water-activity limit for microbial function, ∼0.585 for some strains of fungi, lies far below 0.755. Other biophysical constraints on the microbial biosphere (temperatures of \&gt;121°C; pH \&gt; 12; and high chaotropicity; e.g. ethanol at \&gt;18.9\% w/v (24\% v/v) and MgCl2 at \&gt;3.03 M) can prevent any cellular metabolism or ecosystem function. By contrast, NaCl-saturated environments contain biomass-dense, metabolically diverse, highly active and complex microbial ecosystems; and this underscores their moderate character. Here, we survey the evidence that NaCl-saturated brines are biologically permissive, fertile habitats that are thermodynamically mid-range rather than extreme. Indeed, were NaCl sufficiently soluble, some halophiles might grow at concentrations of up to 8 M. It may be that the finite solubility of NaCl has stabilised the genetic composition of halophile populations and limited the action of natural selection in driving halophile evolution towards greater xerophilicity. Further implications are considered for the origin(s) of life and other aspects of astrobiology.},

	abstract = {The mineral dolomite ((Ca,Mg)CO3) occurs abundantly in the geological record, yet its formation in modern environments is restricted to extreme, hypersaline environments. One possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is that the predominant mode of dolomite formation is the replacement of Ca-carbonate minerals during burial diagenesis (Ryb \& Eiler, 2018). However, another, possibly important factor contributing to high dolomite abundances in the geological past is the existence of sedimentary environments favorable for microbially-mediated dolomite formation. We explore the possibility of distinguishing these modes of dolomite formation using magnesium and strontium stable isotopes in modern sabkah sediment from Qatar and experimentally precipitated dolomite. The distinction of secondary and primary dolomite formation in the sedimentary archive will allow constraining conditions in sedimentary environments in the geological past. Ryb, U., \& Eiler, J. M.

	abstract = {Growth and activity of coastal microbial mats is strongly seasonal. The development of these mats starts in early spring and fully maturate during late summer, where after growth ceases and subsequently the mat deteriorates by erosion and decomposition in winter. Here, the composition of the microbial community of three different mats developing along the tidal gradient of the North Sea beach of the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog was analysed. The 16S ribosomal RNA molecules and the associated gene were sequenced in order to obtain the active (RNA) and resident (DNA) community members, respectively. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated the mats during the whole year but considerable differences among these groups were found along the tidal gradient and seasonally when observed at a finer taxonomic resolution. Richness and diversity increased during the year starting from a pioneering community that is gradually succeeded by a more diverse climax community. The initial pioneers consisted of the cold-adapted photoautotrophic cyanobacterium Nodularia sp. and potential cold adapted members of the alphaproteobacterial Loktanella genus. These pioneers were succeeded by, amongst others, cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Leptolyngbya, Lyngbya, and Phormidium. At the upper littoral (Dune site), which was characterized by an extensive salt marsh vegetation, the mats contained a distinct bacterial community that potentially contribute to or benefit from plant decay. This study reports in detail on the seasonal changes and succession of these coastal microbial mat communities and discusses the potential forces that drive these changes.},

Their high optical density creates a competition for light among phototrophic microalgae and bacteria residing in the uppermost mat layers. Strategies to counter such resource limitation include metabolic investment in protective and light-harvesting pigments enabling exploitation of separate niches in terms of irradiance and spectral composition, or investment in motility to enable migration to an optimal light microenvironment. We used microsensor measurements of light, temperature and gross photosynthesis in coastal microbial mats dominated by motile cyanobacteria and colorless sulfur bacteria to study how migration affected their radiative energy-budgets and relative photosynthetic efficiency. The optical density of the microbial mat was extremely high, and {\textgreater}99\% of incident irradiance of visible light (400–700 nm) was attenuated {\textless}0.4 mm below the surface. While energy conservation efficiency did not change dramatically with previous light acclimation, vertical profiles of photosynthetic efficiency showed a shift in the position of maximum efficiency of ∼0.2 mm, depending on light treatment. Besides avoidance of unfavorable chemical conditions such as high sulfide levels, vertical migration over short distances thus enable cyanobacteria to track zones with optimal light exposure thereby efficiently counteracting detrimental effects of excessive light at the surface and insufficient light deeper in the mat.},

In this paper, the heterotrophic strain DE2010 from a microalgae consortium (Scenedesmus sp.

In addition, changes in the morphology and biomass of this bacterium in response to nitrogen deficiency stress have been evaluated by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) combining differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These isolated bacteria are chemoorganoheterotrophic, gram-negative, and strictly aerobic bacteria that use a variety of amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources, and they grow optimally at 27 °C in a pH range of 5 to 9 and tolerate salinity from 0 to 70‰ NaCl. The DNA-sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and nudC and fixH genes and the metabolic characterization highlight that strain DE2010 corresponds to the species Ochrobactrum anthropi. Cells are rod shaped, 1–3 μm in length, and 0.5 μm wide, but under deprived nitrogen conditions, cells are less abundant and become more round, reducing their length and area and, consequently, their biomass. An increase in the number of pleomorphic cells is observed in cultures grown without nitrogen using different optical and electron microscopy techniques. In addition, the amplification of the fixH gene confirms that Ochrobactrum anthropi DE2010 has the capacity to fix nitrogen, overcoming N2-limiting conditions through a nifH-independent mechanism that is still unidentified.},

Anticipated warming is expected to change the hydrology of these systems due to increased meltwater and reduction of ice cover, with implications for environmental conditions and physical connectivity between habitats. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we evaluated microbial mat and planktonic communities within a connected freshwater system in the McMurdo Wright Valley, Antarctica, to determine the roles of connectivity and habitat conditions in controlling microbial assemblage composition. We examined communities from glacial Lake Brownworth, the perennially ice-covered Lake Vanda and the Onyx River, which connects the two. In Lake Vanda, we found distinct microbial assemblages occupying sub-habitats at different lake depths, while the communities from Lake Brownworth and Onyx River were structurally similar. Despite the higher physical connectivity and dispersal opportunities between bacterial communities in the shallow parts of the system, environmental abiotic conditions dominated over dispersal in driving community structure. Functional metabolic pathway predictions suggested differences in the functional gene potential between the microbial mat communities located in shallower and deeper water depths. The findings suggest that increasing temperatures and meltwater due to future climate change will affect bacterial diversity and functioning in Antarctic freshwater ecosystems.},

High-throughput sequencing showed the predominance of representatives of the Proteobacteria phylum in the microbial mat community (85.5\% of the number of classified bacterial sequences). Among Proteobacteria, filamentous sulfur bacteria of the genus Thiothrix are the most numerous (66.1\%). In addition, bacteria of the families Rhodocyclaceae (3\%) and Comamonadaceae (7.3\%) were present in the mat community. The Bacteroidetes phylum was represented by sequences belonging mainly to the Flavobacteriaceae family (6.8\%). The sequences of other phyla accounted for no more than 0.5\% of the total number of classified sequences. A wide metabolic activity of microorganisms of mat Kucheger-15 was revealed. The high electrogenic ability of microorganisms of the consortium of microbial mats Kucheger-15 in biofuel cells (BFCs) is shown. Mat-based BFCs generated electricity by adding substrates such as peptone, cellulose, starch. Peptone, glucose, tween-80, starch, sodium acetate, and cellulose were used as substrates. Peptone turned out to be the most effective substrate for the production of electricity in BFCs based on Kucheger microbial mat microorganisms. The addition of a mixture of these substrates to the anolyte (the concentration of each of them is 2.5 g/l) made it possible to achieve some increase in energy release (especially the output current) compared to BFC based on each of these substrates separately. The presence of a wide variety of different microorganisms with broad substrate specificity, the ability to function under extreme conditions (high temperature, high pH values), their well-coordinated work and adaptation to each other and to the resulting metabolites, and stability over time allow us to speak of high prospects for the use of hot spring mats in BFC technologies.},

The springs are characterized by low temperature ({\textasciitilde} 15 °C), near-neutral pH (6.7–8.5), and high-sulfide content. In the species composition the benthic microbial communities of Chokrak springs are similar to microbial mats of marine supralittoral and lagoons. Our results showed that salinity limitation had a significant effect on the species composition of benthic microbial communities developing at the outflow of the Chokrak springs. Predominant oxygenic phototrophs belonged to the genera Phormidium, Lyngbya, Leptolyngbya, Geitlerinema, and Arthrospira. Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were represented by halophilic green sulfur bacteria Prosthecochloris spp., halotolerant Chlorobaculum sp., as well as marine and extremely halophilic purple bacteria Roseospira, Rhodovibrio, and Halochromatium.

Daily cycles under in situ natural conditions were monitored from June to October using pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and pigment composition in order to study the photosynthetic performance of these microbial mats in relation to environmental fluctuations linked to irradiance and temperature. In vitro temperature and salinity experiments of photosynthetic responses were also conducted. A total of 10 taxa were identified, the most abundant species being Cyanobacterium sp. and Geitlerinema sp. The microbial mats showed a remarkable photosynthetic adaptation to daily and seasonal changes in temperature and solar radiation. For all microbial mats, rETRmax values decreased from June to October, while Fv/Fm remained constant in terms of absolute values. Although high irradiances during June and July affected photosynthesis through photoinhibition, recovery was observed under high temperatures (between 40–50°C), which supports the hypothesis that temperature is a determining factor in the photosynthetic performance of these cyanobacterial mats. Our results showed a significant increase in the Chla-b and phycobiliproteins content from June to October, as well as a significant decrease in total carotenoids content.},

In some cases, the purpose was to study diversity and evolution of genes that could be grouped within a mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Different protocols have been designed for detection and confirmation that a functional gene was found. In this study, we present a sequence-based screening of candidate genes encoding beta-lactamases in 14 metagenomes of Antarctic microbial mats. The samples were obtained from different sites, representing diverse biogeographic regions of maritime and continental Antarctica. A protocol was designed based on generation of Hidden Markov Models from the four beta-lactamase classes by Ambler classification, using sequences from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The models were used as queries for metagenome analysis and recovered contigs were subsequently annotated using RAST. According to our analysis, 14 metagenomes analyzed contain A, B and C beta-lactamase genes. Class D genes, however, were identified in 11 metagenomes. The most abundant was class C (46.8\%), followed by classes B (35.5\%), A (14.2\%) and D (3.5\%). A considerable number of sequences formed clusters which included, in some cases, contigs from different metagenomes. These assemblies are clearly separated from reference clusters, previously identified using CARD beta-lactamase sequences. While bacterial antibiotic resistance is a major challenge of public health worldwide, our results suggest that environmental diversity of beta-lactamase genes is higher than that currently reported, although this should be complemented with gene function analysis.},

	abstract = {Microbial mats growing under the permanent ice cover of Antarctic lakes occupy an exceptionally low-disturbance regime. Constant temperature, the absence of bioturbation or physical disturbance from wind action or ice formation allow mats to accumulate, as annual growth layers, over many decades or even centuries. In so doing they often assume decimetre scale, three-dimensional morphologies such as elaborate pinnacle structures and conical mounds. Here we combine existing and new information to describe microbial structures in three Antarctic lakes—simple prostrate mats in Lake Hoare, emergent cones in Lake Untersee and elaborate pinnacles in Lake Vanda. We attempt to determine whether structures emerge simply from uncoordinated organism-environment interactions or whether they represent an example of “emergent complexity”, within which some degree of self-organisation occurs to confer a holistic functional advantage to component organisms. While some holistic advantages were evident from the structures—the increase in surface area allows greater biomass and overall productivity and nutrient exchange with overlying water—the structures could also be understood in terms of potential interactions between individuals, their orientation and their environment. The data lack strong evidence of coordinated behaviour directed towards holistic advantages to the structure, though hints of coordinated behaviour are present as non-random distributions of structural elements. The great size of microbial structures in Antarctic lakes, and their relatively simple community composition, makes them excellent models for more focused research on microbial cooperation.},

Due to its remarkable geological, biological and paleontological attributes, determinations of the trophic state of this lagoon may highlight the importance of the environmental conditions that drive microbial mat processes over evolutionary and geological timescales. Analyses of nutrients, phytopigments, biopolymers, and viral and bacterial biomass revealed eutrophic conditions in both the water column and sediments. Accordingly, we classify Vermelha Lagoon as eutrophic. We observed biominerals deposited in microbial mat extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), associated with filamentous green bacteria. X-ray microtomography of microbial mats revealed dome-shaped layers of deposited minerals, both in the cyanobacteria and sulfate-reducing layers. SEM/EDS analysis showed biomineral deposition of carbonate-like CaMg dolomite at the sulfate-reducing zone of microbial mats. Virus-like particles (VLP) were found in high abundance, with Caudovirales being dominant. Bacterial abundance was two-fold higher than VLP at the water–sediment interface where microbial mats occur. Levels of salinity and eutrophication in Vermelha Lagoon allow EPS formation and biomineral deposition by microbial mats, and may influence the relationship between VLP and bacterial cells.},

The formation of dense cell aggregates in liquid medium was a unique characteristic of the strain. Strain LAT grew optimally at 50°C and at pH 7.5.

	abstract = {Thermophilic cyanobacteria have been extensively studied in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) hot springs, particularly from decades of work on the thick laminated mats of Octopus and Mushroom Springs. However, focused studies of cyanobacteria outside of these two hot springs have been lacking, especially regarding how physical and chemical parameters along with community morphology influence the genomic makeup of these organisms. Here, we used a metagenomic approach to examine cyanobacteria existing at the upper temperature limits of photosynthesis. We examined 15 alkaline hot spring samples across six geographic areas of YNP, all with varying physical and chemical parameters, and community morphology. We recovered 22 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to thermophilic cyanobacteria, notably an uncultured Synechococcus-like taxon recovered from the upper temperature limit of photosynthesis, 73°C, in addition to thermophilic Gloeomargarita. Furthermore, we found that three distinct groups of Synechococcus-like MAGs recovered from different temperature ranges vary in their genomic makeup. MAGs from the uncultured very high temperature (up to 73°C) Synechococcus-like taxon lack key nitrogen metabolism genes and have genes implicated in cellular stress responses that diverge from other Synechococcus-like MAGs. Across all parameters measured, temperature was the primary determinant of taxonomic makeup of recovered cyanobacterial MAGs. However, Fe, community morphology, and biogeography played an additional role in the distribution and abundance of upper temperature limit-adapted Synechococcus-like MAGs.These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial diversity in YNP and provide a basis for interrogation of understudied thermophilic cyanobacteria.
Importance Oxygenic photosynthesis arose early in microbial evolution – approx. 2.5-3.5 billion years ago – and entirely reshaped the biological makeup of Earth. However, despite the span of time in which photosynthesis has been refined, it is strictly limited to temperatures below 73°C, a barrier that many other biological processes have been able to overcome. Furthermore, photosynthesis at temperatures above 56°C is limited to circumneutral and alkaline pH. Hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), which have a large diversity in temperatures, pH and geochemistry provide a natural laboratory to study thermophilic microbial mats, and the cyanobacteria within. While cyanobacteria in YNP microbial mats have been studied for decades, a vast majority of work has focused on two springs within the same geyser basin, both containing similar community morphologies. Thus, the drivers of cyanobacterial adaptations to the upper limits of photosynthesis across a variety of environmental parameters have been understudied. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of these parameters on both taxonomic diversity and genomic content of cyanobacteria across a range of hot spring samples.},

Comparing the unique and shared characteristics between different microbial mats could shed new light on the biodiversity, functionality and genetic potential of these habitats. In this study, the taxonomic diversity of a microbial mat from the Araro hot springs (Trans-Mexican volcanic belt) was explored and compared with the metagenomes of microbial mats from Cuatro Ciénegas (Mexico), Guerrero Negro (Mexico), Shark Bay (Australia), Yellowstone (USA), and Diamond Fork (USA). The thermal Araro microbial mat was dominated by the phyla Chloroflexi (particularly Chloroflexus), Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Chlorobium was abundant at Diamond Fork; whereas Thermus, Synechococcus, and Bacillus were found at the remaining locations together with less abundant microbial groups. Alpha diversity indices were highest in Araro, Cuatro Ciénegas, and Shark Bay. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering separated Araro from the remaining microbial mats. SEED subsystems revealed carbohydrate metabolism, amino acids, and derivatives to be dominant functions in most mats, while protein and DNA metabolism were prevalent in Araro. Sequences related to biogeochemical cycles of N, Fe, C, O, and S were observed in all mats except Yellowstone (O cycle only), suggesting the presence of different trophic groups. In summary, the six metagenomes exhibit important taxonomic and functional differences, which could be related to their environmental and physicochemical adaptations.},

In the present study, field observations of these fettuccini-like microbial mats at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park are integrated with geology, geochemistry, hydrology, microscopy, and multi-omic molecular biology analyses. Strategic sampling of living filamentous mats along with the hot-spring CaCO3 (travertine) in which they are actively being entombed and fossilized has permitted the first direct linkage of Sulfurihydrogenibium spp. physiology and metabolism with the formation of distinct travertine streamer microbial biomarkers. Results indicate that, during chemoautotrophy and CO2 carbon fixation, the 87–98\% Sulfurihydrogenibium-dominated mats utilize chaperons to facilitate enzyme stability and function. High-abundance transcripts and proteins for type IV pili and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) are consistent with their strong mucus-rich filaments tens of centimeters long that withstand hydrodynamic shear as they become encrusted by more than 5 mm of travertine per day. Their primary energy source is the oxidation of reduced sulfur (e.g., sulfide, sulfur, or thiosulfate) and the simultaneous uptake of extremely low concentrations of dissolved O2 facilitated by bd-type cytochromes. The formation of elevated travertine ridges permits the Sulfurihydrogenibium-dominated mats to create a shallow platform from which to access low levels of dissolved oxygen at the virtual exclusion of other microorganisms. These ridged travertine streamer microbial biomarkers are well preserved and create a robust fossil record of microbial physiological and metabolic activities in modern and ancient hot-spring ecosystems.},

Microbial mats are precursors of extant stromatolites; however, the mechanisms of transition from mat to stromatolite are controversial and are still not well understood. To fully recognize the profound impact that these ecosystems have had on the evolution of the biosphere requires an understanding of modern lithification mechanisms and how they relate to the geological record. We propose here viral mechanisms in carbonate precipitation, leading to stromatolite formation, whereby viruses directly or indirectly impact microbial metabolisms that govern the transition from microbial mat to stromatolite. Finding a tangible link between host–virus interactions and changes in biogeochemical processes will provide tools to interpret mineral biosignatures through geologic time, including those on Earth and beyond.},

Arsenic is toxic because As and P are similar enough that organisms attempt this substitution. We hypothesize that ancient biochemical systems, analogous to but distinct from those known today, could have utilized arsenate in the equivalent biological role as phosphate.

	abstract = {To evaluate productivity on the early Earth before the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, we integrated estimates of net primary production by early anaerobic metabolisms as limited by geological fluxes of key electron donor compounds, phosphate, and fixed nitrogen. These calculations show that productivity was limited by fluxes of electron donor compounds to rates that were orders of magnitude lower than today. Results suggest that ferrous iron provided a minor fuel for net primary productivity compared to molecular hydrogen. Fluxes of fixed nitrogen and phosphate were in excess of demands by the electron donor-limited biosphere, even without biological nitrogen fixation. This suggests that until life learned to use water as an electron donor for photosynthesis, the size and productivity of the biosphere were constrained by the geological supply of electron donors and there may not have been much ecological pressure to evolve biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, extremely low productivity in the absence of oxygenic photosynthesis has implications for the potential scale of biospheres on icy worlds such as Enceladus and Europa, where photosynthesis is not possible and life would be unable to escape electron donor limitation.},

Despite their structural similarity to fossil microbialites, the presence of oxygen in most modern microbial mats disqualifies them as appropriate models for understanding early Earth conditions. Here we describe the geochemistry, element cycling and lithification potential of microbial mats that thrive under permanently anoxic conditions in arsenic laden, sulfidic waters feeding Laguna La Brava, a hypersaline lake in the Salar de Atacama of northern Chile. We propose that these anoxygenic, arsenosulfidic, phototrophic mats are a link to the Archean because of their distinctive metabolic adaptations to a reducing environment with extreme conditions of high UV, vast temperature fluctuations, and alkaline water inputs from combined meteoric and volcanic origin, reminiscent of early Earth.},

Fungal research has mostly focused on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems where fungi are known as important recyclers of organic matter, whereas viruses are exceptionally abundant and important in aquatic ecosystems. Here, viruses have shown to affect organic matter cycling and the diversity of microbial communities by facilitating horizontal gene transfer and cell lysis. We hypothesise fungi and viruses to have similar roles in microbial mats. Based on the analysis of previous research in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we outline novel hypotheses proposing strong impacts of fungi and viruses on element cycling, food web structure and function in microbial mats, and outline experimental approaches for studies needed to understand these interactions.},

A principal component analyses of the physicochemical parameters showed the samples were separated into three geochemically distinct habitats associated with the location (North, Central, and South). Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi comprised 93\% of the classified community, the former being the most abundant phylum in all samples except for Rocas Calientes 1, (63°C, pH 6), where Chloroflexi and Deinococcus-Thermus represented 84\% of the OTUs. Chloroflexi were more abundant as temperature increased. Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Deinococcus-Thermus comprised 5\% of the OTUs represented. Other Phyla were present in very small percentages ({\textless}1\%). A LINKTREE analysis showed that the community structure of the mats was shaped primarily by pH, separating samples with pH {\textgreater} 6.6 from samples with pH {\textless} 6.4. Thus, both pH and temperature were relevant for community composition even within the moderate ranges of variables studied. These results provide a basis for an understanding of the physicochemical influences in moderately thermophilic microbial mats.},

The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) present in biofilms provide not only surface attachment, but also protection against all kinds of environmental stressors, including desiccation, salinity, temperature or heavy metal pollution. The acquisition of suitable biofilm characteristics might thus be an important process mediating the adaptation of microorganisms to novel environmental conditions. In this work we have characterized the EPS of 20 phylogenetically diverse biofilms collected in situ from five contrasting extreme environments, including two geothermal areas (Copahue, Argentina; Seltun, Iceland), two cold areas (Pastoruri glacier, Peru; Byers Peninsula, Antarctica) and one extremely acidic river (Río Tinto, Spain). Biofilms were subjected to biochemical characterization, glycan profiling and immunoprofiling with an antibody microarray. Our results showed that environmental conditions strongly influence biofilm characteristics, with microorganisms from the same environment achieving similar EPS compositions regardless of the phylogeny of their main species. The concentration of some monosaccharides in the EPS could be related to environmental conditions such as temperature or heavy metal toxicity, suggesting that in some cases stress resistance can be mediated by specific sugars. Overall, our results highlight the existence of conserved EPS compositional patterns for each extreme environment, which could in turn be exploited to engineer ecological adaptations in genetically modified microorganisms.},

Exploiting this result, an ameliorated isolation medium containing 10\% spent-culture supernatant of Tepidimonas sp. strain SYSU G00190W was prepared for targeted isolation of Chloroflexi in the Tibet and Yunnan hot spring samples. 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting characterized majority of the colonies isolated from these media as previously uncultivated Chloroflexi, of which 36 are potential novel species (16S rRNA sequence identity {\textless}98.5\%). Metabolomes studies indicated that the spent-culture supernatant comprises several low-molecular-weight organic substrates that can be utilized as potential nutrients for the growth of these bacteria.

	abstract = {Microbial mats are complex layered biofilms under the effect of continuous daily and seasonal fluctuations in abiotic factors such as nutrients, pH, light, temperature, and salinity. In this study, community variability of microbial mats from the Camargue wetlands (Rhone Delta, southern France) was determined in winter and summer over 2 years, analyzing thin vertical layers at three different depths (0–2, 2–4, and 4–6 mm). Amplicons of the V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to assess changes in the bacterial diversity of the mats. Functionality was inferred according to PICRUSt bioinformatics analysis. The microbial composition of the three layers included more than 30 phyla of bacteria, the major phyla being Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Spirochaetes. The microbial composition of the layers differed significantly, especially between layer 1 (0–2 mm) and the other two, regardless of the season. Cyanobacteria and Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria) were more abundant in layer 1. Chromatiaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) and Deltaproteobacteria were detected in layers 2 (2–4 mm) and 3 (4–6 mm). Flavobacteriaceae was the predominant family of the phylum Bacteroidetes, being especially abundant in layer 3. Spirochaetes were distributed in all three layers, but above all in layer 2. Pathways related to energy and carbohydrate metabolism indicated that the community was more active in summer than in winter. Carbon fixation in the mats was predominantly through the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. Heterotrophic diazotrophs appeared to be responsible for a substantial part of nitrogen input, even more than phototrophic microorganisms. Layers 1 and 2 represented a stressed environment, measured by relative abundances of KEGG Orthologs associated with oxidation, starvation, and osmotic and xenobiotic stress, and suffered unbalanced growth in which there is no increase in cell numbers, but it allows the accumulation of polymers, such as polyhydroxybutyrate. The Camargue mats showed a community homeostasis, its populations adapting to fluctuating conditions while maintaining the characteristic structure of vertically stratified functional groups of microorganisms.},

Yet, the O2 fugacity at the sediment-water interface (SWI) for the earliest animal proliferation is poorly defined. The preferential colonization of seafloor as a first step in animal evolution is also unusual. In order to understand the environmental background, we employed a new proxy, carbonate associated ferrous iron (Fecarb), to quantify the seafloor oxygenation. Fecarb of the latest Ediacaran Shibantan limestone in South China, which yields abundant animal traces, ranges from 2.27 to 85.43 ppm, corresponding to the seafloor O2 fugacity of 162 μmol/L to 297 μmol/L. These values are significantly higher than the oxygen saturation in seawater at the contemporary atmospheric pO2 levels. The highly oxygenated seafloor might be attributed to O2 production of the microbial mats. Despite the moderate atmospheric pO2 level, microbial mats possibly provided highly oxygenated niches for the evolution of benthic metazoans. Our model suggests that the O2 barrier could be locally overcome in the mat ground, questioning the long-held belief that atmospheric oxygenation was the key control of animal evolution.},

The main aim of this study was to identify communities and conditions that are favorable for dolomite formation. We inspected and sampled two locations. The first site was colonized by microbial mats that graded vertically from photo-oxic to anoxic conditions and were dominated by cyanobacteria. The second site, with higher salinity, had mats with an uppermost photo-oxic layer dominated by filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (FAPB), which potentially act as a protective layer against salinity for cyanobacterial species within the deeper layers. Porewater in the uppermost layers of the both investigated microbial mats was supersaturated with respect to dolomite. Corresponding to the variation of the microbial community’s vertical structure, a difference in crystallinity and morphology of dolomitic phases was observed: dumbbell-shaped proto-dolomite in the mats dominated by cyanobacteria and rhombohedral ordered-dolomite in the mat dominated by FAPB.},

The seafloor was mapped using orthophotos acquired by a drone survey and processed using ArcGIS. The map shows the distribution of white microbial mats, former microbial mats, sea grass and ‘normal’ sand down to a depth of 15 m. Generation of a comprehensive map with native shapefiles and layer files, where any GPS coordinate in Paleochori Bay can be obtained, allows to target specific locations for data collection, rather than resorting to vague site descriptions, as has been the practice in the past. Sea floor temperature measurements carried out by Scuba divers in conjunction with GPS coordinates were mapped and interpolated to evaluate the temperature distribution in Paleochori Bay, which in turn supports the overall understanding of the hydrothermal system.},

Rhodopsin sequences isolated from a vast array of marine and terrestrial environments were manually collected and curated. To each rhodopsin sequence are associated related metadata, including predicted spectral tuning of the protein, putative activity and function, taxonomy for sequences that can be linked to a 16S rRNA gene, sampling date and location, and supporting literature. The database currently covers 7857 aligned sequences from more than 450 environmental samples or organisms. Based on a robust phylogenetic analysis, we introduce an operational classification system with multiple phylogenetic levels ranging from superclusters to species-level operational taxonomic units. An integrated pipeline for online sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction is also provided. With a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, this unique resource should be highly valuable for upcoming studies of the biogeography, diversity, distribution and evolution of microbial rhodopsins.Database URL : http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr.},

Brava and Tebenquiche are lakes in the Salar de Atacama, Chile, where microbial communities are growing in extreme conditions, including high salinity, high solar irradiance, and high levels of toxic metals and metaloids. Evaporation creates hypersaline conditions in these lakes and mineral precipitation is a characteristic geomicrobiological feature of these benthic ecosystems. The mat from Brava was more rich and diverse, with a higher number of different taxa and with species more evenly distributed. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant, including {\textasciitilde}75\% of total sequences. At the genus level, the most abundant sequences were affilitated to anoxygenic phototropic and cyanobacterial genera. In Tebenquiche mats, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes covered {\textasciitilde}70\% of the sequences, and 13\% of the sequences were affiliated to Salinibacter genus, thus addressing the lower diversity. Regardless of the differences at the taxonomic level, functionally the two mats were similar. Thus, similar roles could be fulfilled by different organisms. Carbon fixation through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway was well represented in these datasets, and also in other mats from Andean lakes. In spite of presenting less taxonomic diversity, Tebenquiche mats showed increased abundance and variety of rhodopsin genes. Comparison with other metagenomes allowed identifying xantorhodopsins as hallmark genes not only from Brava and Tebenquiche mats, but also for other mats developing at high altitudes in similar environmental conditions.},

Salinity is one of the primary determinants of microbial community structure and can vary strongly along gradients within a variety of habitats. To test the hypothesis that shifts in salinity will also alter the bulk biogeochemical potential of aquatic microbial assemblages, we generated four metagenomic DNA sequence libraries from sediment samples taken along a continuous, natural salinity gradient in the Coorong lagoon, Australia, and compared them to physical and chemical parameters. A total of 392483 DNA sequences obtained from four sediment samples were generated and used to compare genomic characteristics along the gradient. The most significant shifts along the salinity gradient were in the genetic potential for halotolerance and photosynthesis, which were more highly represented in hypersaline samples. At these sites, halotolerance was achieved by an increase in genes responsible for the acquisition of compatible solutes – organic chemicals which influence the carbon, nitrogen and methane cycles of sediment. Photosynthesis gene increases were coupled to an increase in genes matching Cyanobacteria, which are responsible for mediating CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and nitrogen cycles. These salinity driven shifts in gene abundance will influence nutrient cycles along the gradient, controlling the ecology and biogeochemistry of the entire ecosystem.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To further our understanding of the functional genetic potential of these complex microbial ecosystems, we conducted for the first time shotgun metagenomic analyses. We assembled metagenomic next-generation sequencing data to classify the taxonomic and metabolic potential across diverse morphologies of marine mats in Shark Bay. The microbial community across taxonomic classifications using protein-coding and small subunit rRNA genes directly extracted from the metagenomes suggests that three phyla Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteriodetes dominate all marine mats. However, the microbial community structure between Shark Bay and Highbourne Cay (Bahamas) marine systems appears to be distinct from each other. The metabolic potential (based on SEED subsystem classifications) of the Shark Bay and Highbourne Cay microbial communities were also distinct. Shark Bay metagenomes have a metabolic pathway profile consisting of both heterotrophic and photosynthetic pathways, whereas Highbourne Cay appears to be dominated almost exclusively by photosynthetic pathways. Alternative non-rubisco-based carbon metabolism including reductive TCA cycle and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathways is highly represented in Shark Bay metagenomes while not represented in Highbourne Cay microbial mats or any other mat forming ecosystems investigated to date. Potentially novel aspects of nitrogen cycling were also observed, as well as putative heavy metal cycling (arsenic, mercury, copper and cadmium). Finally, archaea are highly represented in Shark Bay and may have critical roles in overall ecosystem function in these modern microbial mats.},

Identifying the spatial distribution of microorganisms with mat depth facilitates a greater understanding of specific niches and potentially novel microbial interactions. High throughput sequencing coupled with elemental analyses and biogeochemical measurements of two distinct mat types (smooth and pustular) at a millimeter scale were undertaken in the present study. A total of 8,263,982 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, which were affiliated to 58 bacterial and candidate phyla. The surface of both mats were dominated by Cyanobacteria, accompanied with known or putative members of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The deeper anoxic layers of smooth mats were dominated by Chloroflexi, while Alphaproteobacteria dominated the lower layers of pustular mats. In situ microelectrode measurements revealed smooth mats have a steeper profile of O2 and H2S concentrations, as well as higher oxygen production, consumption and sulfate reduction rates. Specific elements (Mo, Mg, Mn, Fe, V, P) could be correlated with specific mat types and putative phylogenetic groups. Models are proposed for these systems suggesting putative surface anoxic niches, differential nitrogen fixing niches and those coupled with methane metabolism.},

	abstract = {Microbial mats are organosedimentary structures organized as multilayered carpets of microbial communities. Within the microbial mat microenvironment, the occurrence of different metabolic processes can lead to local chemistry alterations, inducing carbonate precipitation. Carbonate accretion in lithifying microbial mats typically induces microbialite formation, a poorly understood process, but studies have suggested that taxonomic composition of lithifying mats and their predominant metabolic pathways contribute. In contrast to lithifying mats, non-lithifying mats, which do not form microbialites, can sporadically trap carbonate sand grains that are actively bound to the microbial mat through the production of extracellular polymeric substances. Both mat types occur in hypersaline lakes at Rottnest Island (Western Australia) and are currently under threat due to pollution and thus are being managed by the relevant government agency. Characterizing the microbial communities and functional genes of both mat types may help to develop strategies to better manage their ecosystem and elucidate microbialite formation processes. Metagenomics was used to compare the taxonomic and functional diversity of both mat types to determine whether differences in their taxonomy and functional capacity may influence their ability to form microbialites. Results revealed that both mat types harbor taxa (e.g., Firmicutes and Archaea), and functional genes (e.g., associated with photosynthesis, carbon, and sulfur cycles) that are known to play important roles in microbialite formation. This suggests that although non-lithifying mats are not accreting carbonate, they have the potential to form microbialites. Further investigation is needed to determine whether environmental factors could be inhibiting carbonate precipitation within these mats.},

SIP is based on the separation of isotopically labelled DNA or rRNA by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. We have developed a highly sensitive protocol for the detection of ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ nucleic acids in fractions of centrifugation gradients. It involves the fluorometric quantification of total DNA or rRNA, and the quantification of either 16S rRNA genes or 16S rRNA in gradient fractions by real-time PCR with domain-specific primers. Using this approach, we found that fully 13C-labelled DNA or rRNA of Methylobacterium extorquens was quantitatively resolved from unlabelled DNA or rRNA of Methanosarcina barkeri by cesium chloride or cesium trifluoroacetate density gradient centrifugation respectively. However, a constant low background of unspecific nucleic acids was detected in all DNA or rRNA gradient fractions, which is important for the interpretation of environmental SIP results. Consequently, quantitative analysis of gradient fractions provides a higher precision and finer resolution for retrieval of isotopically enriched nucleic acids than possible using ethidium bromide or gradient fractionation combined with fingerprinting analyses. This is a prerequisite for the fine-scale tracing of microbial populations metabolizing 13C-labelled compounds in natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are instrumental to the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems and to the chemistry of the ocean due to their essential part in the cycling of the elements and in the recycling of the organic matter. Two of the most critical ocean biogeochemical cycles are those of nitrogen and sulfur, since they can influence the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, primary productivity and microbial community structure. Oxygen concentration in marine environments is one of the environmental variables that have been largely affected by anthropogenic activities; its decline induces hypoxic events which affect benthic organisms and fisheries. Hypoxia has been traditionally defined based on the level of oxygen below which most animal life cannot be sustained. Hypoxic conditions impact microbial composition and activity since anaerobic reactions and pathways are favoured, at the expense of the aerobic ones. Naturally occurring hypoxia can be found in areas where water circulation is restricted, such as coastal lagoons, and in areas where oxygen-depleted water is driven into the continental shelf, i.e. coastal upwelling regions. Coastal lagoons are highly dynamic aquatic systems, particularly vulnerable to human activities and susceptible to changes induced by natural events. For the purpose of this PhD project, the lagoonal complex of Amvrakikos Gulf, one of the largest semi-enclosed gulfs in the Mediterranean Sea, was chosen as a study site. Coastal upwelling regions are another type of environment limited in oxygen, where also formation of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) has been reported. Sediment in upwelling regions is rich in organic matter and bottom water is often depleted of oxygen because of intense heterotrophic respiration. For the purpose of this PhD project, the chosen coastal upwelling system was the Benguela system off Namibia, situated along the coast of south western Africa. The aim of this PhD project was to study the microbial community assemblages of hypoxic ecosystems and to identify a potential link between their identity and function, with a particular emphasis on the microorganisms involved in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles. The methodology that was applied included targeted metagenomics and RNA stable isotope probing (SIP). It has been shown that the microbial community diversity pattern can be differentiated based on habitat type, i.e. between riverine, lagoonal and marine environments. Moreover, the studied habitats were functionally distinctive. Apart from salinity, which was the abiotic variable best correlated with the microbial community pattern, oxygen concentration was highly correlated with the predicted metabolic pattern of the microbial communities. In addition, when the total number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) was taken into consideration, a negative linear relationship with salinity was identified (see Chapter 2). Microbial community diversity patterns can also be differentiated based on the lagoon under study since each lagoon hosts a different sulfate-reducing microbial (SRM) community, again highly correlated with salinity. Moreover, the majority of environmental terms that characterized the SRM communities were classified to the marine biome, but terms belonging to the freshwater or brackish biomes were also found in stations were a freshwater effect was more evident (see Chapter 3). Taxonomic groups that were expected to be thriving in the sediments of the Benguela coastal upwelling system were absent or present but in very low abundances. Epsilonproteobacteria dominated the anaerobic assimilation of acetate as confirmed by their isotopic enrichment in the SIP experiments. Enhancement of known sulfate-reducers was not achieved under sulfate addition, possibly due to competition for electron donors among nitrate-reducers and sulfate-reducers, to the inability of certain sulfate-reducing bacteria to use acetate as electron donor or to the short duration of the incubations (see Chapter 4). Future research should focus more on the community functioning of such habitats; an increased understanding of the biogeochemical cycles that characterize these hypoxic ecosystems will perhaps allow for predictions regarding the intensity and direction of the cycling of elements, especially of nitrogen and sulfur given their biological importance. Regulation of hypoxic episodes will aid the end-users of these ecosystems to possibly achieve higher productivity, in terms of fish catches, which otherwise is largely compromised by the elevated hydrogen sulfide concentrations.},

	abstract = {Several models have been developed for the description of diversity in estuaries and other brackish habitats, with the most recognized being Remane’s Artenminimum (“species minimum”) concept. It was developed for the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s largest semi-enclosed brackish water body with a unique permanent salinity gradient, and it argues that taxonomic diversity of macrobenthic organisms is lowest within the horohalinicum (5 to 8 psu). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between salinity and sediment microbial diversity at a freshwater-marine transect in Amvrakikos Gulf (Ionian Sea, Western Greece) and assess whether species composition and community function follow a generalized concept such as Remane’s. DNA was extracted from sediment samples from six stations along the aforementioned transect and sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene using high-throughput sequencing. The metabolic functions of the OTUs were predicted and the most abundant metabolic pathways were extracted. Key abiotic variables, i.e., salinity, temperature, chlorophyll-a and oxygen concentration etc., were measured and their relation with diversity and functional patterns was explored. Microbial communities were found to differ in the three habitats examined (river, lagoon and sea) with certain taxonomic groups being more abundant in the freshwater and less in the marine environment, and vice versa. Salinity was the environmental factor with the highest correlation to the microbial community pattern, while oxygen concentration was highly correlated to the metabolic functional pattern. The total number of OTUs showed a negative relationship with increasing salinity, thus the sediment microbial OTUs in this study area do not follow Remane’s concept.},

Pairing with the impetus offered by high-throughput methods to key areas such as non-model organism studies, their operation continuously evolves to meet the corresponding computational challenges. Here, we present a Tier 2 (regional) HPC facility, operating for over a decade at the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology, and Aquaculture of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research in Greece. Strategic choices made in design and upgrades aimed to strike a balance between depth (the need for a few high-memory nodes) and breadth (a number of slimmer nodes), as dictated by the idiosyncrasy of the supported research. Qualitative computational requirement analysis of the latter revealed the diversity of marine fields, methods, and approaches adopted to translate data into knowledge. In addition, hardware and software architectures, usage statistics, policy, and user management aspects of the facility are presented. Drawing upon the last decade’s experience from the different levels of operation of the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology, and Aquaculture HPC facility, a number of lessons are presented; these have contributed to the facility’s future directions in light of emerging distribution technologies (e.g., containers) and Research Infrastructure evolution. In combination with detailed knowledge of the facility usage and its upcoming upgrade, future collaborations in marine research and beyond are envisioned.},

	abstract = {On a bacterial scale, the interface between a microbial mat and the overflowing water is a remarkable environment governed by low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, by diffusional solute transport, and by exposure to extreme chemical fluctuations and gradients. The thin surface layer of benthic phototrophic mats, in which all photosynthesis and most of the respiration of the mat community takes place, is generally about a mm thick. Yet, these mats have a productivity and organic turn-over of a similar magnitude as planktonic ecosystems. Since the euphoric zone of mats is typically 103–105-fold thinner than that of the water column, the microbial activity per unit volume is correspondingly 103–105-fold higher. As a consequence, there is a dynamic balance between the rapid production and consumption of oxygen, the concentration of which may fluctuate between {\textgreater} 1 atm. partial pressure and total depletion within minutes during shifting light conditions. The microorganisms living at the mat surface are physiologically adapted to these chemical extremes. Many also have a highly developed motility and tactic response to the environmental factors. The responses are often simple for the individual cells, but together they may lead to complex behavioral patterns of the whole populations. This paper will review some of the microbiologically important properties of the interface and how some bacteria are adapted to this environment.},

The main focus is on photofermentation systems conducted on biomass derived substrates, as these are considered to be the applicative goal of hydrogen production. Indeed, it is also present a short excursus on some synthetic media, investigated as interesting opportunities for enlarging applicability of the hydrogen technology.

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial mats developing in oil-contaminated sabkhas along the African coasts of the Gulf of Suez and in the pristine Solar Lake, Sinai, were collected for laboratory studies. Samples of both mats showed efficient degradation of crude oil in the light, followed by development of an intense bloom of Phormidium spp. and Oscillatoria spp. Isolated cyanobacterial strains, however, did not degrade crude oil in axenic cultures. Strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria and aerobic heterotrophs were capable of degrading model compounds of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Results indicate that degradation of oil was done primarily by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The oxygenic photosynthesis of oil-insensitive cyanobacteria supplied the molecular oxygen for the efficient aerobic metabolism of organisms, such as Marinobacter sp. The diurnal shifts in environmental conditions at the mat surface, from highly oxic conditions in the light to anaerobic sulfide-rich habitat in the dark, may allow the combined aerobic and anaerobic degradation of crude oil at the mat surface. Hence, coastal cyanobacterial mats may be used for the degradation of coastline oil spills. Oxygen microelectrodes detected a significant inhibition of photosynthetic activity subsequent to oil addition. This prevailed for a few hours and then rapidly recovered. In addition, shifts in bacterial community structure following exposure to oil were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified fractions of 16S rRNA from eubacteria, cyanobacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Since the mats used for the present study were obtained from oil-contaminated environments, they were believed to be preequilibrated for petroleum remediation. The mesocosm system at Eilat provided a unique opportunity to study petroleum degradation by mats formed under different salinities (up to 21\%). These mats, dominated by cyanobacteria, can serve as close analogues to the sabkhas contaminated during the Gulf War in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.},

	abstract = {We used a novel amperometric microsensor for measuring hydrogen gas production and consumption at high spatio-temporal resolution in cyanobacterial biofilms and mats dominated by non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria (Microcoleus chtonoplastes and Oscillatoria sp.). The new microsensor is based on the use of an organic electrolyte and a stable internal reference system and can be equipped with a chemical sulfide trap in the measuring tip; it exhibits very stable and sulfide-insensitive measuring signals and a high sensitivity (1.5–5 pA per μmol L-1 H2). Hydrogen gas measurements were done in combination with microsensor measurements of scalar irradiance, O2, pH, and H2S and showed a pronounced H2 accumulation (of up to 8–10\% H2 saturation) within the upper mm of cyanobacterial mats after onset of darkness and O2 depletion. The peak concentration of H2 increased with the irradiance level prior to darkening. After an initial build-up over the first 1–2 h in darkness, H2 was depleted over several hours due to eﬄux to the overlaying water, and due to biogeochemical processes in the uppermost oxic layers and the anoxic layers of the mats. Depletion could be prevented by addition of molybdate pointing to sulfate reduction as a major sink for H2. Immediately after onset of illumination, a short burst of presumably photo-produced H2 due to direct biophotolysis was observed in the illuminated but anoxic mat layers. As soon as O2 from photosynthesis started to accumulate, the H2 was consumed rapidly and production ceased. Our data give detailed insights into the microscale distribution and dynamics of H2 in cyanobacterial biofilms and mats, and further support that cyanobacterial H2 production can play a significant role in fueling anaerobic processes like e.g., sulfate reduction or anoxygenic photosynthesis in microbial mats.},

The chemical composition of the active extracts was analysed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Cyanobacteria within these mats were identified by direct microscopy while the total bacterial community composition was compared using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Only the extracts from Bowshar and Nakhl mats showed antibacterial properties against Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All tested extracts inhibited the growth of the benthic diatom Amphora coffeaeformis. Extracts from Bowshar, Rustaq and Nakhl inhibited quorum-sensing of the reporter strains Chromobacterium violaceum CV017 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL4. The highest bioactivity was recorded for ethyl acetate extracts from Nakhl mats, which had the lowest number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Using GC-MS, 74 chemical compounds were obtained, however with different distribution among the four mat extracts (similarity {\textless} 43\%). Various cyanobacteria, belonging mainly to Chroococcus, Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, Spirulina and Lyngbya were detected in the different mats, and each mat had its unique bacterial community, as confirmed by ARISA profiles. We conclude that antimicrobial and quorum-sensing inhibitory compounds can be produced by hot spring mat microorganisms under natural conditions and the differences in these compounds could be attributed to the differences in the mats’ bacterial composition as well as the physical–chemical conditions of the springs.},

	abstract = {Microbial mats are dynamic and complex ecosystems exhibiting spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The physical/chemical environment is typified by steep gradients and distinct microenvironments. These microenvironments support a great diversity of species with a wide range of metabolic processes. These processes often result in coupled reactions and biogeochemical cycles, and produce important end products such as trace gases and mineral precipitates. The latter can impact the composition and character of the sediment, imparting a “biosignature.” These biosignatures can be preserved in the rock record and are useful in the interpretation of fossil record on Earth and possibly as an indication of life on other planetary bodies. The modern marine stromatolites of the Exuma Cays, Bahamas, provide an ideal system for studying the populations, processes, and products in a microbial ecosystem using a multidisciplinary approach. In order to acquire redox energy, microbial populations need to carry out metabolic reactions at rates faster than the equivalent chemical (abiotic) reactions. As such, microbes can be viewed as bioreactors that preferably oxidize carbon to CO2 to maximize the energy yield. The study of the microbial role in carbonate sedimentation and lithification in these stromatolites provides a picture of microbial mats as bioreactors producing a biosignature.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial–bacterial consortial associations are taxonomically complex, metabolically interactive, self-sustaining prokaryotic communities representing pioneer and often the only biota inhabiting extreme aquatic and terrestrial environments. Laminated mats and aggregates exemplify such communities. The fossil record indicates that these associations represent the earliest extant inhabitants and modifiers (i.e. anoxic to oxic conditions) of the Earth's biosphere. Present-day consortia flourish in physically and chemically stressed environments, including nutrient-deplete, hypersaline, calcified, desiccated and high-irradiance ecosystems ranging from the tropics to polar regions. Consortial members exhibit extensive metabolic diversification, but have remained structurally simple. Structural simplicity, while advantageous in countering environmental extremes, presents a ‘packaging problem’ with regard to compartmentalizing potentially cross-inhibitory aerobic versus anaerobic growth processes. To circumvent these metabolic constraints, phototrophic cyanobacteria and microheterotrophs orient along microscale chemical (i.e. O2, pH, Eh) gradients to meet and optimize the biogeochemical processes (C, N, S cycling) essential for survival, growth and the maintenance of genetic diversity, needed to sustain life. Microscale ecophysiological, analytical, molecular (immunological and nucleic acid) techniques have helped to develop a mechanistic basis for understanding consortial growth and survival under extreme environmental conditions on Earth. Consortia are ideal model systems for developing a process-based understanding of the structural and functional requirements for life in extreme environments representative of the Earth's earliest biosphere and possibly other planets.},

Much of this new productivity probably occurred in microbial mats, which incorporate a range of photosynthetic and anaerobic microorganisms in extremely close physical proximity2,3. The potential contribution of these systems to global biogeochemical change would have depended on the nature of the interactions among these mat microorganisms. Here we report that in modern, cyanobacteria-dominated mats from hypersaline environments in Guerrero Negro, Mexico, photosynthetic microorganisms generate H2 and CO—gases that provide a basis for direct chemical interactions with neighbouring chemotrophic and heterotrophic microbes4. We also observe an unexpected flux of CH4, which is probably related to H2-based alteration of the redox potential within the mats. These fluxes would have been most important during the nearly 2-billion-year period during which photosynthetic mats contributed substantially to biological productivity5—and hence, to biogeochemistry—on Earth. In particular, the large fluxes of H2 that we observe could, with subsequent escape to space, represent a potentially important mechanism for oxidation of the primitive oceans and atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Microbial mats characteristically are dominated by a few functional groups of microbes: cyanobacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Their combined metabolic activities result in steep environmental microgradients, particularly of oxygen and sulfide. The driving force of most microbial mats is photosynthesis by cyanobacteria and algae. Subsequently, sulfate-reducing bacteria, using excretion-, lysis-, and decomposition products of cyanobacteria, produce sulfide by the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate. The sulfide can be reoxidized to sulfate by colorless and purple sulfur bacteria. Colorless sulfur bacteria are chemotrophic organisms primarily oxidizing sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur with oxygen to obtain energy. The oxidation of reduced sulfur species also provides reducing equivalents for the reduction of carbon dioxide to cellular carbon. The final product of sulfide oxidation is sulfate, with elemental sulfur, deposited extracellularly, as the principal intermediate. Purple sulfur bacteria primarily are anaerobic phototrophic organisms using sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur exclusively as the electron donor for the reduction of CO2 to cellular carbon. Usually, sulfur is temporarily stored intracellularly. The final product of the oxidation of reduced forms of sulfur is sulfate. The niches for these metabolically different groups of microbes in ecosystems with steep, often non-overlapping, gradients of oxygen and sulfide appear to be spatially separated. However, maximum viable counts of colorless sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria were both found in the top 5–10 mm of mats. Unexpectedly, viable counts of sulfate-reducing bacteria also peaked at the same depth horizon. Sulfide is inhibitory for most oxygenic phototrophs. Sulfide production immediately underneath the layer of cyanobacteria might inhibit their growth, and, consequently, that of the entire ecosystem. In microbial mats this effect is minimized by the combined action of colorless and purple sulfur bacteria. Colorless sulfur bacteria generally have a much higher affinity for sulfide than purple sulfur bacteria, however, in microbial mats, their activity is hampered by low oxygen supply rates. As shown by pure culture studies with colorless sulfur bacteria, sulfide is incompletely oxidized when oxygen is short in supply, resulting in the production of potential electron donors for purple sulfur bacteria, such as sulfur, thiosulfate and polysulfides. In the absence of purple sulfur bacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria would not be able to maintain a low sulfide concentration due to shortage of oxygen, which in turn would result in increased inhibition of oxygenic photosynthesis. It thus appears that the combined action of all four groups of functional microbes mentioned effectively results in optimal growth of these recent “stromatolites”.},

Community diversity of microbial mat samples was assessed at 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. in a combined analysis consisting of 16S rRNA-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles. The divergence index determined from PLFA and DGGE data showed that depth-related differences have a greater influence on diversity than temporal variations. Shannon and Simpson indices yielded similar values in all samples, which suggested the stable maintenance of a structurally diverse microbial community. The increased diversity observed at 3:00 p.m. between 2.5 and 4 mm can be explained mainly by diversification of anaerobic microorganisms, especially sulfate-reducing bacteria. In the afternoon sampling, the diversity index reflected a higher diversity between 4 and 5.5 mm depth, which suggested an increase in the diversity of strict anaerobes and fermenters. The results are consistent with the conclusion that hypersaline microbial mats are characterized by high degree of diversity that shifts in response to the photobiological adaptations and metabolic status of the microbial community.},

Incident irradiance exponentially attenuated in the same zone reaching 1\% at 1.7-mm depth. Proteobacteria dominated all layers of the mat (24\%–42\% of the identified bacteria). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (dominated by Chloroflexus) were most abundant in the third red layer of the mat (L3), evidenced by the spectral signature of Bacteriochlorophyll as well as by sequencing. The deep, black layer (L4) was dominated by sulfate reducing bacteria belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria, which were responsible for high sulfate reduction rates (measured using 35S tracer). Members of Halobacteria were the dominant Archaea in all layers of the mat (92\%–97\%), whereas Nematodes were the main Eukaryotes (up to 87\%). Primary productivity rates of Um Alhool mat were similar to those of other hypersaline microbial mats. However, sulfate reduction rates were relatively low, indicating that oxygenic respiration contributes more to organic material degradation than sulfate reduction, because of bioturbation. Although Um Alhool hypersaline mat is a nutrient-limited ecosystem, it is interestingly dynamic and phylogenetically highly diverse. All its components work in a highly efficient and synchronized way to compensate for the lack of nutrient supply provided during regular inundation periods.},

Microbial mats are small-scale, nearly closed, and self-sustaining benthic ecosystems that comprise the major element cycles, trophic levels, and food webs. The steep and fluctuating physicochemical microgradients, that are the result of the ever changing environmental conditions and of the microorganisms' own activities, give rise to a plethora of potential niches resulting in the formation of one of the most diverse microbial ecosystems known to date. For several decades, microbial mats have been studied extensively and more recently molecular biological techniques have been introduced that allowed assessing and investigating the diversity and functioning of these systems.

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are often the key organisms comprising microbial mats. They form dense micrometer-scale communities in which the full plethora of microbial metabolism can be present. Such mats are therefore excellent model systems and because of their analogy with Precambrian stromatolites they are also attractive subjects for evolutionary studies. Growth and metabolism of the oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacteria enrich the sediment with organic matter. However, in mature mats net growth of cyanobacteria appears to be of less importance. Most of the organic matter produced from photosynthetic CO2 fixation is liberated in the sediment by one of the following: fermentation, photorespiration, pouring out of solutes or secretion of mucus although grazing may also be important. This organic matter is degraded by chemotrophic microorganisms, among which sulphate-reducing bacteria are particularly prominent. The combined activities of the cyanobacteria and sulphate-reducing bacteria result in steep and fluctuating gradients of sulphide and oxygen. Cyanobacteria therefore have to cope with high concentrations of sulphide, oxygen supersaturated – and anoxic conditions. These physicochemical gradients force different functional groups of microorganisms to particular vertical stratified positions in the mat. This, and the fact that accretion of sediment fluctuates, gives rise to one of the most conspicuous properties of microbial mats namely their laminated structure. Modern microbial mats have this laminated structure in common with Precambrian stromatolites. Most modern mats do not lithify but this may also have been the case for Archean microbial mats. Only a few examples of modern calcifying stromatolithic microbial mats are known. A hypothesis has been developed which conceives a role for extracellular polysaccharides in calcification. Extracellular polysaccharides in cyanobacterial mats are often produced as the result of unbalanced growth caused by nitrogen deficiency. The mat organisms are embedded in the extensive polysaccharide matrix that inhibits calcification. All cyanobacterial mats can fix atmospheric dinitrogen, which covers part of their nitrogen demand, but the fluctuating physicochemical gradients limits the efficiency of this process.},

	abstract = {With the growing anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems, the need for efficient monitoring of biodiversity grows stronger. DNA metabarcoding of bulk samples is increasingly being implemented in ecosystem assessments and is more cost-efficient and less time-consuming than monitoring based on morphology. However, before raw sequences are obtained from bulk samples, a profound number of methodological choices must be made. Here, we critically review the recent methods used for metabarcoding of marine bulk samples (including benthic, plankton and diet samples) and indicate how potential biases can be introduced throughout sampling, preprocessing, DNA extraction, marker and primer selection, PCR amplification and sequencing. From a total of 64 studies evaluated, our recommendations for best practices include to (a) consider DESS as a fixative instead of ethanol, (b) use the DNeasy PowerSoil kit for any samples containing traces of sediment, (c) not limit the marker selection to COI only, but preferably include multiple markers for higher taxonomic resolution, (d) avoid touchdown PCR profiles, (e) use a fixed annealing temperature for each primer pair when comparing across studies or institutes, (f) use a minimum of three PCR replicates, and (g) include both negative and positive controls. Although the implementation of DNA metabarcoding still faces several technical complexities, we foresee wide-ranging advances in the near future, including improved bioinformatics for taxonomic assignment, sequencing of longer fragments and the use of whole-genome information. Despite the bulk of biases involved in metabarcoding of bulk samples, if appropriate controls are included along the data generation process, it is clear that DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable tool in ecosystem assessments.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA sequencing has revealed the expansive biodiversity of microorganisms and clarified the relationship between host-associated microbial communities and host phenotype. Shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is a relatively new and powerful environmental sequencing approach that provides insight into community biodiversity and function. But, the analysis of metagenomic sequences is complicated due to the complex structure of the data. Fortunately, new tools and data resources have been developed to circumvent these complexities and allow researchers to determine which microbes are present in the community and what they might be doing. This review describes the analytical strategies and specific tools that can be applied to metagenomic data and the considerations and caveats associated with their use. Specifically, it documents how metagenomes can be analyzed to quantify community structure and diversity, assemble novel genomes, identify new taxa and genes, and determine which metabolic pathways are encoded in the community. It also discusses several methods that can be used compare metagenomes to identify taxa and functions that differentiate communities.},

	abstract = {The analysis of microbiota composition in humans, animals, and built environments is important because of emerging roles and applications in a broad range of disease and ecological phenotypes. Next Generation Sequencing is the current method of choice to characterize microbial community composition. The taxonomic profile of a microbial community can be obtained either by shotgun analysis of random DNA fragments or through 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon sequencing. It has been previously shown that the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach yields quantitatively and qualitatively different results compared to shotgun metagenomics when the two techniques are used to assess microbial community composition on the same samples. However, most of such comparisons were either based on the recovery of 16S rDNA sequences in the shotgun metagenomics data or limited to a single microbiome or synthetic samples. Direct comparison of shotgun metagenomics and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on the same samples was performed only once in the recent literature, suggesting that the two methods yield comparable results. Here, we set out to compare the outcome of these two alternative approaches to the microbiome characterization in human gut microbiomes from stool samples. To this end, we processed six different samples with both techniques. We report here that shotgun next generation sequencing metagenomics allows much deeper characterization of the microbiome complexity, allowing identification of a larger number of species for each sample, compared to 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Further comparative studies in independent samples are called for.},

	abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere, and have the ability to infect Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. The virome is estimated to be at least ten times more abundant than the microbiome with 107 viruses per milliliter and 109 viral particles per gram in marine waters and sediments or soils, respectively. Viruses represent a largely unexplored genetic diversity, having an important role in the genomic plasticity of their hosts. Moreover, they also play a significant role in the dynamics of microbial populations. In recent years, metagenomic approaches have gained increasing popularity in the study of environmental viromes, offering the possibility of extending our knowledge related to both virus diversity and their functional characterization. Extreme environments represent an interesting source of both microbiota and their virome due to their particular physicochemical conditions, such as very high or very low temperatures and {\textgreater}1 atm hydrostatic pressures, among others. Despite the fact that some progress has been made in our understanding of the ecology of the microbiota in these habitats, few metagenomic studies have described the viromes present in extreme ecosystems. Thus, limited advances have been made in our understanding of the virus community structure in extremophilic ecosystems, as well as in their biotechnological potential. In this review, we critically analyze recent progress in metagenomic based approaches to explore the viromes in extreme environments and we discuss the potential for new discoveries, as well as methodological challenges and perspectives.},

	abstract = {Rapid advancements in sequencing technologies along with falling costs present widespread opportunities for microbiome studies across a vast and diverse array of environments. These impressive technological developments have been accompanied by a considerable growth in the number of methodological variables, including sampling, storage, DNA extraction, primer pairs, sequencing technology, chemistry version, read length, insert size, and analysis pipelines, amongst others. This increase in variability threatens to compromise both the reproducibility and the comparability of studies conducted. Here we perform the first reported study comparing both amplicon and shotgun sequencing for the three leading next-generation sequencing technologies. These were applied to six human stool samples using Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq and Ion PGM shotgun sequencing, as well as amplicon sequencing across two variable 16S rRNA gene regions. Notably, we found that the factor responsible for the greatest variance in microbiota composition was the chosen methodology rather than the natural inter-individual variance, which is commonly one of the most significant drivers in microbiome studies. Amplicon sequencing suffered from this to a large extent, and this issue was particularly apparent when the 16S rRNA V1-V2 region amplicons were sequenced with MiSeq. Somewhat surprisingly, the choice of taxonomic binning software for shotgun sequences proved to be of crucial importance with even greater discriminatory power than sequencing technology and choice of amplicon. Optimal N50 assembly values for the HiSeq was obtained for 10 million reads per sample, whereas the applied MiSeq and PGM sequencing depths proved less sufficient for shotgun sequencing of stool samples. The latter technologies, on the other hand, provide a better basis for functional gene categorisation, possibly due to their longer read lengths. Hence, in addition to highlighting methodological biases, this study demonstrates the risks associated with comparing data generated using different strategies. We also recommend that laboratories with particular interests in certain microbes should optimise their protocols to accurately detect these taxa using different techniques.},

	abstract = {Molecular identification of mixed-species pollen samples has a range of applications in various fields of research. To date, such molecular identification has primarily been carried out via amplicon sequencing, but whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of pollen DNA has potential advantages, including (1) more genetic information per sample and (2) the potential for better quantitative matching. In this study, we tested the performance of WGS sequencing methodology and publicly available reference sequences in identifying species and quantifying their relative abundance in pollen mock communities. Using mock communities previously analyzed with DNA metabarcoding, we sequenced approximately 200Mbp for each sample using Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq. Taxonomic identifications were based on the Kraken k-mer identification method with reference libraries constructed from full-genome and short read archive data from the NCBI database. We found WGS to be a reliable method for taxonomic identification of pollen with near 100\% identification of species in mixtures but generating higher rates of false positives (reads not identified to the correct taxon at the required taxonomic level) relative to rbcL and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. For quantification of relative species abundance, WGS data provided a stronger correlation between pollen grain proportion and sequence read proportion, but diverged more from a 1:1 relationship, likely due to the higher rate of false positives. Currently, a limitation of WGS-based pollen identification is the lack of representation of plant diversity in publicly available genome databases. As databases improve and costs drop, we expect that eventually genomics methods will become the methods of choice for species identification and quantification of mixed-species pollen samples.},

To gain insights into genus definition for the prokaryotes, we attempted to reveal the genus-level genomic differences in the current prokaryotic classification system and to delineate the boundary of a genus on the basis of genomic information. The average nucleotide sequence identity between two genomes can be used for prokaryotic species delineation, but it is not suitable for genus demarcation. We used the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) between two strains to estimate their evolutionary and phenotypic distance. A comprehensive genomic survey indicated that the POCP can serve as a robust genomic index for establishing the genus boundary for prokaryotic groups. Basically, two species belonging to the same genus would share at least half of their proteins. In a specific lineage, the genus and family/order ranks showed slight or no overlap in terms of POCP values. A prokaryotic genus can be defined as a group of species with all pairwise POCP values higher than 50\%. Integration of whole-genome data into the current taxonomy system can provide comprehensive information for prokaryotic genus definition and delimitation.},

	abstract = {Despite {\textgreater}130 years of microbial cultivation studies, many microorganisms remain resistant to traditional cultivation approaches, including numerous candidate phyla of bacteria and archaea. Unraveling the mysteries of these candidate phyla is a grand challenge in microbiology and is especially important in habitats where they are abundant, including some extreme environments and low-energy ecosystems. Over the past decade, parallel advances in DNA amplification, DNA sequencing and computing have enabled rapid progress on this problem, particularly through metagenomics and single-cell genomics. Although each approach suffers limitations, metagenomics and single-cell genomics are particularly powerful when combined synergistically. Studies focused on extreme environments have revealed the first substantial genomic information for several candidate phyla, encompassing putative acidophiles (Parvarchaeota), halophiles (Nanohaloarchaeota), thermophiles (Acetothermia, Aigarchaeota, Atribacteria, Calescamantes, Korarchaeota, and Fervidibacteria), and piezophiles (Gracilibacteria). These data have enabled insights into the biology of these organisms, including catabolic and anabolic potential, molecular adaptations to life in extreme environments, unique genomic features such as stop codon reassignments, and predictions about cell ultrastructure. In addition, the rapid expansion of genomic coverage enabled by these studies continues to yield insights into the early diversification of microbial lineages and the relationships within and between the phyla of Bacteria and Archaea. In the next 5 years, the genomic foliage within the tree of life will continue to grow and the study of yet-uncultivated candidate phyla will firmly transition into the post-genomic era.},

Microorganisms, biological processes, and environment types are identified and mapped to ontology terms from established community resources. Analyses of comentions in text and co-occurrences in metagenomics data/metadata are performed to extract associations and a level of confidence is assigned to each of them thanks to a scoring scheme. The PREGO knowledge base contains associations for 364,508 microbial taxa, 1090 environmental types, 15,091 biological processes, and 7971 molecular functions with a total of almost 58 million associations. These associations are available through a web portal, an Application Programming Interface (API), and bulk download. By exploring environments and/or processes associated with each other or with microbes, PREGO aims to assist researchers in design and interpretation of experiments and their results. To demonstrate PREGO’s capabilities, a thorough presentation of its web interface is given along with a meta-analysis of experimental results from a lagoon-sediment study of sulfur-cycle related microbes.},

GTDB R06-RS202 spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270\% increase since the introduction of the GTDB in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200\% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.},

	abstract = {The new release of the All-Species Living Tree Project (LTP) represents an important step forward in the reconstruction of 16S rRNA gene phylogenies, since we not only provide an updated set of type strain sequences until December 2020, but also a series of improvements that increase the quality of the database. An improved universal alignment has been introduced that is implemented in the ARB format. In addition, all low-quality sequences present in the previous releases have been substituted by new entries with higher quality, many of them as a result of whole genome sequencing. Altogether, the improvements in the dataset and 16S rRNA sequence alignment allowed us to reconstruct robust phylogenies. The trees made available through this current LTP release feature the best topologies currently achievable. The given nomenclature and taxonomic hierarchy reflect all the changes available up to December 2020. The aim is to regularly update the validly published nomenclatural classification changes and new taxa proposals.

	abstract = {The Chloroflexi superphylum have been investigated primarily from the perspective of reductive dehalogenation of toxic compounds, anaerobic photosynthesis and wastewater treatment, but remain relatively little studied compared to their close relatives within the larger Terrabacteria group, including Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Here, we conducted a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the phylum Chloroflexota, the phylogenetically proximal candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota, and a newly defined sibling phylum proposed in the current study, Eulabeiota. These groups routinely root together in phylogenomic analyses, and constitute the Chloroflexi supergroup. Chemoautotrophy is widespread in Chloroflexi. Two Form I Rubisco ancestral subtypes that both lack the small subunit are prevalent in ca. Eulabeiota and Chloroflexota, suggesting that the predominant modern pathway for CO2 fixation evolved in these groups. The single subunit Form I Rubiscos are inferred to have evolved prior to oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere and now predominantly occur in anaerobes. Prevalent in both Chloroflexota and ca. Eulabeiota are capacities related to aerobic oxidation of gases, especially CO and H2. In fact, aerobic and anaerobic CO dehydrogenases are widespread throughout every class-level lineage, whereas traits such as denitrification and reductive dehalogenation are heterogeneously distributed across the supergroup. Interestingly, some Chloroflexota have a novel clade of group 3 NiFe hydrogenases that is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported groups. Overall, the analyses underline the very high level of metabolic diversity in the Chloroflexi supergroup, suggesting the ancestral metabolic platform for this group enabled highly varied adaptation to ecosystems that appeared in the aerobic world.},

Here, we applied culture-independent shotgun metagenomics to thoroughbred equine faecal samples to deliver novel insights into this complex microbial community. Results We performed metagenomic sequencing on five equine faecal samples to construct 123 high- or medium-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from Bacteria and Archaea. In addition, we recovered nearly 200 bacteriophage genomes. We document surprising taxonomic diversity, encompassing dozens of novel or unnamed bacterial genera and species, to which we have assigned new Candidatus names. Many of these genera are conserved across a range of mammalian gut microbiomes. Conclusions Our metagenomic analyses provide new insights into the bacterial, archaeal and bacteriophage components of the horse gut microbiome. The resulting datasets provide a key resource for future high-resolution taxonomic and functional studies on the equine gut microbiome.},

N. equitans fails to amplify with standard archaeal 16S PCR primers and can only be amplified using specifically designed primers. We have designed a new set of universal archaeal primers that amplify the 16S rRNA gene of all four archaeal sub-divisions, and present two new sets of Nanoarchaeota-specific primers based on all known nanoarchaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences. These primers can be used to detect N. equitans and have generated nanoarchaeal amplicons from community DNA extracted from Chinese, New Zealand, Chilean and Tibetan hydrothermal sites. Sequence analysis indicates that these environments harbour novel nanoarchaeal phylotypes, which, however, do not cluster into clear phylogeographical clades. Mesophilic hypersaline environments from Inner Mongolia and South Africa were analysed using the nanoarchaeal-specific primers and found to contain a number of nanoarchaeal phylotypes. These results suggest that nanoarchaeotes are not strictly hyperthermophilic organisms, are not restricted to hyperthermophilic hosts and may be found in a large range of environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Past studies of hydrogen cycling in hypersaline microbial mats have shown an active nighttime cycle, with production largely from Cyanobacteria and consumption from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). However, the mechanisms and magnitude of hydrogen cycling have not been extensively studied. Two mats types near Guerrero Negro, Mexico—permanently submerged Microcoleus microbial mat (GN-S), and intertidal Lyngbya microbial mat (GN-I)—were used in microcosm diel manipulation experiments with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), molybdate, ammonium addition, and physical disruption to understand the processes responsible for hydrogen cycling between mat microbes. Across microcosms, H2 production occurred under dark anoxic conditions with simultaneous production of a suite of organic acids. H2 production was not significantly affected by inhibition of nitrogen fixation, but rather appears to result from constitutive fermentation of photosynthetic storage products by oxygenic phototrophs. Comparison to accumulated glycogen and to CO2 flux indicated that, in the GN-I mat, fermentation released almost all of the carbon fixed via photosynthesis during the preceding day, primarily as organic acids. Across mats, although oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs were detected, cyanobacterial [NiFe]-hydrogenase transcripts predominated. Molybdate inhibition experiments indicated that SRBs from a wide distribution of DsrA phylotypes were responsible for H2 consumption. Incubation with 13C-acetate and NanoSIMS (secondary ion mass-spectrometry) indicated higher uptake in both Chloroflexi and SRBs relative to other filamentous bacteria. These manipulations and diel incubations confirm that Cyanobacteria were the main fermenters in Guerrero Negro mats and that the net flux of nighttime fermentation byproducts (not only hydrogen) was largely regulated by the interplay between Cyanobacteria, SRBs, and Chloroflexi.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis first emerged in prokaryotes over three billion years ago and represents one of the most fundamental biological processes on Earth. So far, species capable of performing (bacterio)chlorophyll-based phototrophy have been reported in seven bacterial phyla, i.e., Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Here we review the discovery, physiology, genomic characteristics, environmental distribution, and possible evolutionary origin of the bacterium Gemmatimonas phototrophica strain AP64, so far the only phototrophic member of the phylum Gemmatimonadetes. This organism was isolated from a freshwater lake in the Gobi Desert, North China in 2011. It contains fully functional type-2 photosynthetic reaction centers, but they seem to only serve as an auxiliary energy source. Its photosynthesis genes are located in a 42.3 kb long photosynthesis gene cluster which appear to originate from an ancient horizontal gene transfer from a purple phototrophic bacterium. A survey of biomarker genes of phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes bacteria (PGB) in public environmental genomics databases suggests that PGB are widely distributed in diverse environments, including air, river waters/sediment, estuarine waters, lake waters, biofilms, plant surfaces, intertidal sediments, soils, springs, and wastewater treatment plants, but none from marine waters or sediment. PGB make up roughly 0.4–11.9 \% of whole phototrophic microbial communities in these habitats. The discovery of PGB presents a strong evidence that genes for anoxygenic phototrophy can be transferred between distant bacterial phyla, providing new insights into the evolution of bacterial photosynthesis.},

Here we describe the discovery that Heimdallarchaeota genomes are enriched for proteins formerly considered specific to photosynthetic apparatus and are suggestive performing oxygenic photosynthesis. Our results provide strong support for hypotheses in which Heimdallarchaeota harvest light by bacteriochlorophyll and/or carotenoid, then transport electron from photosystems to Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle along with CO2 fixation and ATP biosynthesis, and release oxygen as a waste product. Given the possessing of phototrophic lifestyle together with other anaerobic and aerobic metabolic pathways, Heimdallarchaeota are firmly believed to be photomixotrophic and have a facultative aerobic metabolism. Our results expand our knowledge that archaea have played an important role in the molecular evolution of eukaryotic photosynthesis and raise the significant possibility that Heimdallarchaeota might be ancestor of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms.},

	abstract = {Photosynthetic bacteria are abundant in alkaline, terrestrial hot springs and there is a long history of research on phototrophs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Hot springs provide a framework to examine the ecophysiology of phototrophs in situ because they provide natural gradients of geochemistry, pH and temperature. Phototrophs within the Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi groups are frequently observed in alkaline hot springs. Decades of research has determined that temperature constrains Cyanobacteria in alkaline hot springs, but factors that constrain the distribution of phototrophic Chloroflexi remain unresolved. Using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and photoassimilation microcosms, we tested the hypothesis that temperature would constrain the activity and composition of phototrophic Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi. We expected diversity and rates of photoassimilation to decrease with increasing temperature. We report 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing along with carbon isotope signatures and photoassimilation from 45 to 72°C in two alkaline hot springs. We find that Roseiflexus, Chloroflexus (Chloroflexi) and Leptococcus (Cyanobacteria) operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have distinct distributions with temperature. This distribution suggests that, like phototrophic Cyanobacteria, temperature selects for specific phototrophic Chloroflexi taxa. The richness of phototrophic Cyanobacteria decreased with increasing temperature along with a decrease in oxygenic photosynthesis, whereas Chloroflexi richness and rates of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not decrease with increasing temperature, even at temperatures approaching the upper limit of photosynthesis ( 72–73°C). Our carbon isotopic data suggest an increasing prevalence of the 3-hydroxypropionate pathway with decreasing temperature coincident with photoautotrophic Chloroflexi. Together these results indicate temperature plays a role in defining the niche space of phototrophic Chloroflexi (as has been observed for Cyanobacteria), but other factors such as morphology, geochemistry, or metabolic diversity of Chloroflexi, in addition to temperature, could determine the niche space of this highly versatile group.},

Microorganisms within terrestrial aquifer sediments control buried organic carbon turnover, degrade organic contaminants, and impact drinking water quality. Recent 16S rRNA gene profiling indicates that members of the bacterial phylum Chloroflexi are common in sediment. Only the role of the class Dehalococcoidia, which degrade halogenated solvents, is well understood. Genomic sampling is available for only six of the approximate 30 Chloroflexi classes, so little is known about the phylogenetic distribution of reductive dehalogenation or about the broader metabolic characteristics of Chloroflexi in sediment. Results: We used metagenomics to directly evaluate the metabolic potential and diversity of Chloroflexi in aquifer sediments. We sampled genomic sequence from 86 Chloroflexi representing 15 distinct lineages, including members of eight classes previously characterized only by 16S rRNA sequences. Unlike in the Dehalococcoidia, genes for organohalide respiration are rare within the Chloroflexi genomes sampled here. Near-complete genomes were reconstructed for three Chloroflexi. One, a member of an unsequenced lineage in the Anaerolinea, is an aerobe with the potential for respiring diverse carbon compounds. The others represent two genomically unsampled classes sibling to the Dehalococcoidia, and are anaerobes likely involved in sugar and plant-derived-compound degradation to acetate. Both fix CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, a pathway not previously documented in Chloroflexi. The genomes each encode unique traits apparently acquired from Archaea, including mechanisms of motility and ATP synthesis. Conclusions: Chloroflexi in the aquifer sediments are abundant and highly diverse. Genomic analyses provide new evolutionary boundaries for obligate organohalide respiration. We expand the potential roles of Chloroflexi in sediment carbon cycling beyond organohalide respiration to include respiration of sugars, fermentation, CO2 fixation, and acetogenesis with ATP formation by substrate-level phosphorylation.},

	abstract = {Modern laminated photosynthetic microbial mats are ideal environments to study how microbial activity creates and modifies carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures prior to lithification. Laminated microbial mats from a hypersaline lagoon (Guerrero Negro, Baja California, Mexico) maintained in a flume in a greenhouse at NASA Ames Research Center were sampled for δ13C of organic material and carbonate to assess the impact of carbon fixation (e.g., photosynthesis) and decomposition (e.g., bacterial respiration) on δ13C signatures. In the photic zone, the δ13Corg signature records a complex relationship between the activities of cyanobacteria under variable conditions of CO2 limitation with a significant contribution from green sulfur bacteria using the reductive TCA cycle for carbon fixation. Carbonate is present in some layers of the mat, associated with high concentrations of bacteriochlorophyll e (characteristic of green sulfur bacteria) and exhibits δ13C signatures similar to DIC in the overlying water column (−2.0‰), with small but variable decreases consistent with localized heterotrophic activity from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Model results indicate respiration rates in the upper 12 mm of the mat alter in situ pH and concentrations to create both phototrophic CO2 limitation and carbonate supersaturation, leading to local precipitation of carbonate minerals. The measured activity of SRB with depth suggests they variably contribute to decomposition in the mat dependent on organic substrate concentrations. Millimeter-scale variability in the δ13Corg signature beneath the photic zone in the mat is a result of shifting dominance between cyanobacteria and green sulfur bacteria with the aggregate signature overprinted by heterotrophic reworking by SRB and methanogens. These observations highlight the impact of sedimentary microbial processes on δ13Corg signatures; these processes need to be considered when attempting to relate observed isotopic signatures in ancient sedimentary strata to conditions in the overlying water column at the time of deposition and associated inferences about carbon cycling.},

	abstract = {Photosystem II, the water oxidizing enzyme, altered the course of evolution by filling the atmosphere with oxygen. Here, we reconstruct the origin and evolution of water oxidation at an unprecedented level of detail by studying the phylogeny of all D1 subunits, the main protein coordinating the water oxidizing cluster (Mn4CaO5) of Photosystem II. We show that D1 exists in several forms making well-defined clades, some of which could have evolved before the origin of water oxidation and presenting many atypical characteristics. The most ancient form is found in the genome of Gloeobacter kilaueensis JS-1 and this has a C-terminus with a higher sequence identity to D2 than to any other D1. Two other groups of early evolving D1 correspond to those expressed under prolonged far-red illumination and in darkness. These atypical D1 forms are characterized by a dramatically different Mn4CaO5 binding site and a Photosystem II containing such a site may assemble an unconventional metal cluster. The first D1 forms with a full set of ligands to the Mn4CaO5 cluster are grouped with D1 proteins expressed only under low oxygen concentrations and the latest evolving form is the dominant type of D1 found in all cyanobacteria and plastids. In addition, we show that the plastid ancestor had a D1 more similar to those in early branching Synechococcus. We suggest each one of these forms of D1 originated from transitional forms at different stages toward the innovation and optimization of water oxidation before the last common ancestor of all known cyanobacteria.},

This urge has led to an incessant stream of speculative ideas and debates on the evolution of photosynthesis that started in the first half of the twentieth century and shows no signs of abating. Some of these speculative ideas have become commonplace, are taken as fact, but find little support. Here, I review and scrutinize three widely accepted ideas that underpin the current study of the evolution of photosynthesis: first, that the photochemical reaction centres used in anoxygenic photosynthesis are more primitive than those in oxygenic photosynthesis; second, that the probability of acquiring photosynthesis via horizontal gene transfer is greater than the probability of losing photosynthesis; and third, and most important, that the origin of anoxygenic photosynthesis pre-dates the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. I shall attempt to demonstrate that these three ideas are often grounded in incorrect assumptions built on more assumptions with no experimental or observational support. I hope that this brief review will not only serve as a cautionary tale but also that it will open new avenues of research aimed at disentangling the complex evolution of photosynthesis and its impact on the early history of life and the planet.},

We recovered three nanoarchaeotal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (M10-121), Guaymas Basin (Gua-46) and the Mid-Cayman Rise (MC-1). Based on average amino acid identity analysis, M10-121 is a novel species in the candidate genus Nanoclepta, while the other two MAGs represent novel genera in the Nanoarchaeota. Like previously sequenced Nanoarchaeota, each MAG encodes at least one split protein-coding gene. The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for gluconeogenesis and archaeal flagella. MC-1 also encodes the pentose bisphosphate pathway, which may allow the nanoarchaeote to bypass several steps in glycolysis and produce ATP.},

Another widely distributed and abundant group was that of anaerobic bacteria of the genus Caldimicrobium (phylum Thermodesulfobacteria). Archaea of the genus Vulcanisaeta were abundant in a high-temperature, slightly acidic hot spring, where they were accompanied by numerous Nanoarchaeota, while the domination of uncultured Thermoplasmataceae A10 was characteristic for moderately thermophilic acidic habitats. The highest rates of inorganic carbon assimilation determined by the in situ incubation of samples in the presence of 14C-labeled bicarbonate were found in oxygen-dependent streamers; in two sediment samples taken from the hottest springs this process, though much weaker, was found to be not dependent on oxygen.

Significant homonucleotide repeats (HR) were observed in pyrosequence reads and in near full-length Sanger sequences, averaging 112 HR per 1349 bp clone and could confound diversity estimates derived from pyrosequencing, resulting in false nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels). However, Sanger sequencing of two different sets of PCR clones (110 bp, 1349 bp) demonstrated that at least some of these indels are real. The majority of the Nanoarchaeota PCR amplicons were vent associated; however, curiously, one relatively small Nanoarchaeota OTU (71 pyrosequencing reads) was only found in photic zone water samples obtained from a region of the lake furthest removed from the hydrothermal regions of the lake. Extensive pyrosequencing failed to demonstrate the presence of an Ignicoccus lineage in this lake, suggesting the Nanoarchaeota in this environment are associated with novel Archaea hosts.

Ancient subterranean salt deposits (evaporites) are common throughout the world, and the majority sampled to date appear to support diverse populations of halobacteria. The inaccessibility of deep subsurface deposits, and the special requirements of these organisms for survival, make contamination by halobacteria from surface sites unlikely. It is conceivable that these subterranean halobacteria are autochthonous, presumably relict populations derived from ancient hypersaline seas that have been revived from a state of dormancy. One would predict that halobacteria that have been insulated and isolated inside ancient evaporites would be different from comparable bacteria from surface environments, and that it might be possible to use a molecular chronometer to establish if the evolutionary position of the subsurface isolates correlated with the geological age of the evaporite. Extensive comparisons have been made between the 16S rRNA genes of surface and subsurface halobacteria without showing any conclusive differences between the two groups. A further phylogenetic comparison exploits an unusual feature of one particular group of halobacteria that possess at least two heterogeneous copies of the 16S rRNA gene, the sequences of which may have been converging or diverging over geological time. However, results to date have yet to show any gene sequence differences between surface and evaporite-derived halobacteria that might arguably be an indication of long-term dormancy.},

	abstract = {The surface charge of brain endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is highly negative due to phospholipids in the plasma membrane and the glycocalyx. This negative charge is an important element of the defense systems of the BBB. Lidocaine, a cationic and lipophilic molecule which has anaesthetic and antiarrhytmic properties, exerts its actions by interacting with lipid membranes. Lidocaine when administered intravenously acts on vascular endothelial cells, but its direct effect on brain endothelial cells has not yet been studied. Our aim was to measure the effect of lidocaine on the charge of biological membranes and the barrier function of brain endothelial cells. We used the simplified membrane model, the bacteriorhodopsin (bR) containing purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum and culture models of the BBB. We found that lidocaine turns the negative surface charge of purple membrane more positive and restores the function of the proton pump bR. Lidocaine also changed the zeta potential of brain endothelial cells in the same way. Short-term lidocaine treatment at a 10 μM therapeutically relevant concentration did not cause major BBB barrier dysfunction, substantial change in cell morphology or P-glycoprotein efflux pump inhibition. Lidocaine treatment decreased the flux of a cationic lipophilic molecule across the cell layer, but had no effect on the penetration of hydrophilic neutral or negatively charged markers. Our observations help to understand the biophysical background of the effect of lidocaine on biological membranes and draws the attention to the interaction of cationic drug molecules at the level of the BBB.
The photosensitive protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) has been shown to be a promising material for optoelectronic applications, but it cannot effectively absorb and utilize light energy in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the optical spectrum. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have two-photon absorption cross-sections two orders of magnitude larger than those of bR and can effectively transfer the up-converted energy of two NIR photons to bR via the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we have engineered a photoelectrochemical cell based on a hybrid material consisting of QDs and bR-containing purple membranes (PMs) of Halobacterium salinarum and demonstrated that this cell can generate an electrical signal under the two-photon laser excitation. We have shown that the efficiency of light conversion by the PM–QD hybrid material under two-photon excitation is up to 4.3 times higher than the efficiency of conversion by PMs alone. The QD integration into the bR-containing PMs significantly improves the bR capacity for utilizing light upon two-photon laser excitation, thus paving the way to the engineering of biologically inspired hybrid NIR nonlinear optoelectronic elements. The nonlinear nature of two-photon excitation may provide considerable advantages, such as a sharp sensitivity threshold and the possibility of precise three-dimensional location of excitation in holography and optical computing.
Although interactions between lipids and membrane proteins (MPs) have been considered crucially important for understanding the functions of lipids, lack of useful and convincing experimental methods has hampered the analysis of the interactions. Here, we developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based concise method for quantitative analysis of lipid-MP interactions, coating the sensor chip surface with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with C6-chain. To develop this method, we used bacteriorhodopsin (bR) as an MP, and examined its interaction with various types of lipids. The merits of using C6-SAM-modified sensor chip are as follows: (1) alkyl-chains of SAM confer a better immobilization of MPs because of the efficient preconcentration due to hydrophobic contacts; (2) SAM provides immobilized MPs with a partial membranous environment, which is important for the stabilization of MPs; and (3) a thinner C6-SAM layer (1 nm) compared with MP size forces the MP to bulge outward from the SAM surface, allowing extraneously injected lipids to be accessible to the hydrophobic transmembrane regions. Actually, the amount of bR immobilized on C6-SAM is 10 times higher than that on a hydrophilic CM5 sensor chip, and AFM observations confirmed that bR molecules are exposed on the SAM surface. Of the lipids tested, S-TGA-1, a halobacterium-derived glycolipid, had the highest specificity to bR with a nanomolar dissociation constant. This is consistent with the reported co-crystal structure that indicates the formation of several intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, we not only reproduced the specific lipid-bR recognition, but also succeeded in its quantitative evaluation, demonstrating the validity and utility of this method.
Haloarchaea are salt-loving microorganisms that are members of the Third Domain of Life, the Archaea. They possess compact guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich genomes with large extrachromosomal replicons. Genome analysis of a common genus of Haloarchaea, Halobacterium, isolated from salts and salted foods from geographically diverse locations has shown that they contain stable and conserved 2-mega base pairs (Mbp) chromosomes and diverse megaplasmids containing many transposable insertion sequence (IS) elements. In this chapter, we provide an overview on Haloarchaea, followed by a case study on the comparative genomics of closely related Halobacterium species. We detail results on the 2 most highly studied, completely sequenced Halobacterium strains, NRC-1 and R-1, and genotypic analysis of 16 additional strains isolated from diverse locations. Our results illustrate the small number of differences in the main chromosome, and a large number of variations found in the plasmids, and suggest the existence of multiple clades (operational taxonomical units or OTUs) in the Halobacterium genus.
Tyrosine 185 (Y185), one of the aromatic residues within the retinal (Ret) chromophore binding pocket in helix F of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), is highly conserved among the microbial rhodopsin family proteins. Many studies have investigated the functions of Y185, but its underlying mechanism during the bR photocycle remains unclear. To address this research gap, in situ two-dimensional (2D) magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) of specifically labelled bR, combined with light-induced transient absorption change measurements, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, titration analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, was used to elucidate the functional roles of Y185 during the bR photocycle in the native membrane environment. Different interaction modes were identified between Y185 and the Ret chromophore in the dark-adapted (inactive) state and M (active) state, indicating that Y185 may serve as a rotamer switch maintaining the protein dynamics, and plays an important role in the efficient proton-pumping mechanism in the bR purple membrane.},

The genera Haloquadratum and Halorhabdus were found in all sampling sites. While Haloquadratum, Haloarcula, and Halorhabdus were the most abundant genera, two uncultured Tuz Lake Halobacteria (TLHs) 1 and 2 were detected in high abundance, and an additional uncultured haloarchaeal TLH-3 was found as a minor abundant uncultured taxon. Their future isolation in pure culture would permit us to expand our knowledge on hypersaline thalassohaline habitats, as well as their ecological role and biomedical and biotechnological potential applications.},

We assessed rates of sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, and anaerobic oxidation of methane using radiotracers and generated 16S rRNA gene libraries from the microbial communities inhabiting the deep calcium-chloride-rich brine and sediments of Lake Vanda, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Sulfate reduction rates were observed in surface sediments but not in the brine overlying the sediments. Methane formation through the methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and hydrogenotrophic pathways was quantified using 14C-labeled methylamine, acetate, and CO2, respectively, and methanogenesis was detected in both the brine and the sediments. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rates were the highest of all substrates tested in the sediments, while methylotrophic methanogenesis was highest in the brines. Anaerobic oxidation of methane was below the limit of detection in both the brines and sediments. The major taxa of Bacteria and Archaea detected were most similar to organisms previously observed in hypersaline environments and included examples related to known sulfate-reducing bacteria other than Deltaproteobacteria (surprisingly, sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria were not observed in this study), and both methanogenic and methanotrophic Archaea. These data indicate an active microbial community in the anoxic brine of Lake Vanda that while similar in terms of community structure and metabolism to other brine habitats, is uniquely evolved to survive in this extreme environment.},

We compare two next-generation sequencing techniques – amplicon and shotgun – on water samples across four of Brazil’s major river floodplain systems (Amazon, Araguaia, Paraná, and Pantanal). Less than 50\% of phyla identified via amplicon sequencing were recovered from shotgun sequencing, clearly challenging the dogma that mid-depth shotgun recovers more diversity than amplicon-based approaches. Amplicon sequencing also revealed {\textasciitilde}27\% more families. Overall the amplicon data were more robust across both biodiversity and community ecology analyses at different taxonomic scales. Our work doubles the sampling size in similar environmental studies, and novelly integrates environmental data (e.g., pH, temperature, nutrients) from each site, revealing divergent correlations depending on which data are used. While myriad variants on NGS techniques and bioinformatic pipelines are available, our results point to core differences that have not been highlighted in any studies to date. Given the low number of taxa identified when coupling shotgun data with clade-based taxonomic algorithms, previous studies that quantified biodiversity using such bioinformatic tools should be viewed cautiously or re-analyzed. Nonetheless, shotgun has complementary advantages that should be weighed when designing projects.},

This hot spring is a shallow, 150-m-long, fast-flowing stream, with temperatures varying from 50 to 110°C and a pH range of 7.0–9.0. Hidden within a wooded area, the SK hot spring is continually fed by plant litter, resulting in a relatively high degree of total organic content (TOC). In this study, a sample taken from the middle of the stream was analyzed at the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region by amplicon metagenome sequencing. Over 35 phyla were detected by analyzing the 16S rRNA data. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria represented approximately 57\% of the microbiome. Approximately 70\% of the detected thermophiles were strict anaerobes; however, Hydrogenobacter spp., obligate chemolithotrophic thermophiles, represented one of the major taxa. Several thermophilic photosynthetic microorganisms and acidothermophiles were also detected. Most of the phyla identified by 16S rRNA were also found using the shotgun metagenome approaches. The carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolism within the SK hot spring community were evaluated by shotgun metagenome sequencing, and the data revealed diversity in terms of metabolic activity and dynamics. This hot spring has a rich diversified phylogenetic community partly due to its natural environment (plant litter, high TOC, and a shallow stream) and geochemical parameters (broad temperature and pH range). It is speculated that symbiotic relationships occur between the members of the community.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms from all domains of life establish associations with plants. Although some harm the plant, others antagonize pathogens or prime the plant immune system, support the acquisition of nutrients, tune plant hormone levels, or perform additional services. Most culture-independent plant microbiome research has focused on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and/or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genomic loci, which show the relative abundance of the microbes to each other. Here, we describe shotgun sequencing of 275 wild Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiomes from southwest Germany, with additional bacterial 16S and eukaryotic ITS1 rRNA amplicon data from 176 of these samples. Shotgun data, which unlike the amplicon data capture the ratio of microbe to plant DNA, enable scaling of microbial read abundances to reflect the microbial load on the host. In a more cost-effective hybrid strategy, we show they also allow a similar scaling of amplicon data to overcome compositionality problems. Our wild plants were dominated by bacterial sequences, with eukaryotes contributing only a minority of reads. Microbial membership showed weak associations with both site of origin and plant genotype, both of which were highly confounded in this dataset. There was large variation among microbiomes, with one extreme comprising samples of low complexity and a high load of microorganisms typical of infected plants, and the other extreme being samples of high complexity and a low microbial load. Critically, considering absolute microbial load led to fundamentally different conclusions about microbiome assembly and the interaction networks among major taxa.},

However, in relation to its size and physical heterogeneity we have limited understanding of taxonomic and metabolic diversity in this realm. Here we present a detailed metagenomic analysis of samples from the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) spanning depths from the surface to 1.5 km deep in the crust. From these eight geochemically and spatially distinct fluid samples we reconstructed ∼600 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), representing 50 distinct phyla and including 18 candidate phyla. These novel clades include many members of the Patescibacteria superphylum and two new MAGs from candidate phylum OLB16, a phylum originally identified in DeMMO fluids and for which only one other MAG is currently available. We find that microbes spanning this expansive phylogenetic diversity and physical space are often capable of numerous dissimilatory energy metabolisms and are poised to take advantage of nutrients as they become available in relatively isolated fracture fluids. This metagenomic dataset is contextualized within a four-year geochemical and 16S rRNA time series, adding another invaluable piece to our knowledge of deep subsurface microbial ecology.},

	abstract = {The linear biosynthetic pathway leading from α-ketoisovalerate to pantothenate (vitamin B5) and on to CoA comprises eight steps in the Bacteria and Eukaryota. Genes for up to six steps of this pathway can be identified by sequence homology in individual archaeal genomes. However, there are no archaeal homologs to known isoforms of pantothenate synthetase (PS) or pantothenate kinase. Using comparative genomics, we previously identified two conserved archaeal protein families as the best candidates for the missing steps. Here we report the characterization of the predicted PS gene from Methanosarcina mazei, which encodes a hypothetical protein (MM2281) with no obvious homologs outside its own family. When expressed in Escherichia coli, MM2281 partially complemented an auxotrophic mutant without PS activity. Purified recombinant MM2281 showed no PS activity on its own, but the enzyme enabled substantial synthesis of [14C]4′-phosphopantothenate from [14C]β-alanine, pantoate and ATP when coupled with E. coli pantothenate kinase. ADP, but not AMP, was detected as a coproduct of the coupled reaction. MM2281 also transferred the 14C-label from [14C]β-alanine to pantothenate in the presence of pantoate and ADP, presumably through isotope exchange. No exchange took place when pantoate was removed or ADP replaced with AMP. Our results indicate that MM2281 represents a novel type of PS that forms ADP and is strongly inhibited by its product pantothenate. These properties differ substantially from those of bacterial PS, and may explain why PS genes, in contrast to other pantothenate biosynthetic genes, were not exchanged horizontally between the Bacteria and Archaea.},

These enzymes are widely distributed in nature and have important functions in fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, polyketide biosynthesis, urea utilization, and other cellular processes. ACCs are also attractive targets for drug discovery against type 2 diabetes, obesity, cancer, microbial infections, and other diseases, and the plastid ACC of grasses is the target of action of three classes of commercial herbicides. Deficiencies in the activities of PCC, MCC, or PC are linked to serious diseases in humans. Our understanding of these enzymes has been greatly enhanced over the past few years by the crystal structures of the holoenzymes of PCC, MCC, PC, and UC. The structures reveal unanticipated features in the architectures of the holoenzymes, including the presence of previously unrecognized domains, and provide a molecular basis for understanding their catalytic mechanism as well as the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC, MCC, and PC.

In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.},

	abstract = {While all names of new taxa submitted to the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, either in direct submissions or in validation requests for names effectively published elsewhere, are subject to nomenclatural review to ensure that they are acceptable based on the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, the names of Candidatus taxa have not been subjected to such a review. Formally, this was not necessary because the rank of Candidatus is not covered by the Code, and the names lack the priority afforded validly published names. However, many Candidatus taxa of different ranks are widely discussed in the scientific literature, and a proposal to incorporate the nomenclature of uncultured prokaryotes under the provisions of the Code is currently pending. Therefore, an evaluation of the names of Candidatus taxa published thus far is very timely. Out of the {\textasciitilde}400 Candidatus names found in the literature, 120 contradict the current rules of the Code or are otherwise problematic. A list of those names of Candidatus taxa that need correction is presented here and alternative names that agree with the provisions of the Code are proposed.,},

	abstract = {Naming of uncultured Bacteria and Archaea is often inconsistent with the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. The recent practice of proposing names for higher taxa without designation of lower ranks and nomenclature types is one of the most important inconsistencies that needs to be addressed to avoid nomenclatural instability. The Code requires names of higher taxa up to the rank of class to be derived from the type genus name, with a proposal pending to formalise this requirement for the rank of phylum. Designation of nomenclature types is crucial for providing priority to names and ensures their uniqueness and stability. However, only legitimate names proposed for axenic cultures can be used for this purpose. Candidatus names reserved for taxa lacking cultured representatives may be granted this right if recent proposals to use genome sequences as type material are endorsed, thereby allowing the Code to be fully applied to lineages represented by metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) or single amplified genomes (SAGs). Genome quality standards need to be considered to ensure unambiguous assignment of type material. Here, we illustrate the recommended practice by proposing nomenclature type material for four major uncultured prokaryotic lineages based on high-quality MAGs in accordance with the Code.},

	abstract = {Background The chicken is the most abundant food animal in the world. However, despite its importance, the chicken gut microbiome remains largely undefined. Here, we exploit culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to reveal extensive taxonomic diversity within this complex microbial community. Results We performed metagenomic sequencing of fifty chicken faecal samples from two breeds and analysed these, alongside all (n = 582) relevant publicly available chicken metagenomes, to cluster over 20 million non-redundant genes and to construct over 5,500 metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes. In addition, we recovered nearly 600 bacteriophage genomes. This represents the most comprehensive view of taxonomic diversity within the chicken gut microbiome to date, encompassing hundreds of novel candidate bacterial genera and species. To provide a stable, clear and memorable nomenclature for novel species, we devised a scalable combinatorial system for the creation of hundreds of well-formed Latin binomials. We cultured and genome-sequenced bacterial isolates from chicken faeces, documenting over forty novel species, together with three species from the genus Escherichia, including the newly named species Escherichia whittamii. Conclusions Our metagenomic and culture-based analyses provide new insights into the bacterial, archaeal and bacteriophage components of the chicken gut microbiome. The resulting datasets expand the known diversity of the chicken gut microbiome and provide a key resource for future high-resolution taxonomic and functional studies on the chicken gut microbiome.},
