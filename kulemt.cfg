%% Define known master's programmes and their options
%%   The definition of the master's programme contains the following elements:
%%    1. "N" or "E" : the language of the master's programme
%%                    "N" for dutch, "E" for English
%%    2. Number for faculty identification (use braces if > 1 digit)
%%       0 = multiple faculties
%%       1 = Faculty of Engineering Science
%%    3. "F" or "N" : if "F", a filing card is always required
%%    4. Master's programme colours "{bg:fg}" or "{bg}", with each colour
%%       a comma separated list of C,M,Y,K fractions.
%%    5. Master's thesis title between braces
%%    6. Optional copyright contact info {<address>:<phone>:<email>}
%%       Use faculty information if empty
%%    7. Optional list of master's programme option abbreviations
%%       Each option is surrounded by braces and consists of an
%%       abbreviation, followed by ":" and the title of the option.
%%       Optionally the list can start with a list of abbreviations
%%       between square brackets. If this list is not empty, an error
%%       is raised when no option is specified by the student.
%%       If the list equals "-", no options are allowed.
%%    8. Optional list of obsolete master's programme option abbreviations.
%%       The list has the same format as the list of master's programme options.
%%       You have to make sure that the abbreviations don't conflict
%%       with those of the master's programme options. The convention is to
%%       append a dot and the last year it was valid.
