% The xspace package provides a single command that looks at what comes after it in the command stream, and decides whether to insert a space to replace one “eaten” by the TEX command decoder. The decision is based on what came after any space, not on whether there was a space (which is unknowable): so if the next thing proves to be punctuation, the chances are there was no space, but if it’s a letter, there’s probably a need for space. This technique is not perfect, but works in a large proportion of cases.

% PREFACE
\begin{preface}
  
   \textit{The problem is to construct a third view, one that sees the entire world neither as an indissoluble whole nor with the equally incorrect, but currently dominant, view that at every level the world is made up of bits and pieces that can be isolated and that have properties that can be studied in isolation. Both ideologies [...] prevent a rich understanding of nature and prevent us from solving the problems to which science is supposed to apply itself. \\
